在中医理论中，肺司呼吸是基本生理功能之一，而当体内有瘀血时，则需采用祛瘀生新之法以恢复健康。若患者出现小便黄赤等症状，可能伴有寒凉药不宜使用的情况，此时宜选用辛温通窍之品，促进气血流通。对于某些顽固性疾病如疳病，采用活血消癥的方法可以有效改善症状。同时，在治疗过程中合理运用利水渗湿药物，有助于排除体内湿气，达到标本兼治的效果。通过这些方法，可以更好地调理身体，恢复健康状态。

Translation
In TCM theory, the lung governs breathing, which is one of the basic physiological functions. When there is stagnant blood in the body, the method of eliminating stasis and regenerating blood should be used to restore health. If the patient presents symptoms such as yellow, reddish urine, it may be inappropriate to use cold/cool-property medicines. In this case, pungent warm herbs that dissipate cold and open the orifices should be selected to promote the circulation of qi and blood. For stubborn diseases like infantile malnutrition, the method of circulating blood and resolving masses can effectively improve symptoms. At the same time, during treatment, appropriately using diuretic and dampness-permeating drugs can help eliminate dampness from the body, achieving the effect of treating both the tip and root. Through these methods, the body can be better regulated to restore a healthy state.
