Translation
Scrub typhus occurs in relation to the invasion of external pathogens, and kidney essence deficiency pattern is one of its important pathological foundations. Clinically, patients may exhibit symptoms such as muttering. During treatment, it is necessary to focus on regulating the waning of yin or yang, and for patients with spleen yang deficiency with water retention pattern and qi deficiency with phlegm retention pattern, a method of strengthening the spleen and removing dampness should be adopted, while also taking into account the pattern identification and treatment of the organ system patterns.
