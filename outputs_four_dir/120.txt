在探讨鼻病类疾病时，我们注意到鼻疳作为一种常见病症，其发生与两仪失衡密切相关。据《黄帝内经》记载，人体阴阳平衡是健康之本，而鼻病的发生则常源于阴阳失调。本文旨在通过分析初关阶段的临床表现，结合气能摄血理论，探讨汤剂在治疗鼻疳中的应用。研究表明，合理运用石蛾等药材配伍的汤剂，可以有效改善鼻疳症状，恢复患者健康。同时，对于痹证的治疗亦有启示，提示我们在临床实践中重视药物的选择与配伍。通过对上述理论与实践的综合分析，本文进一步论证了中医辨证施治在鼻病治疗中的重要性。

Translation
In exploring nasal diseases, we have noted that nasal sores, as a common condition, are closely related to the disharmony of the two complementary forces. According to the Huangdi Neijing, the balance between Yin and Yang is the foundation of health, while the occurrence of nasal diseases often originates from the disharmony between Yin and Yang. This article aims to analyze the clinical manifestations at the initial stage through the lens of Qi controlling blood theory, and discuss the application of decoctions in treating nasal sores. Research indicates that the rational use of decoctions with herb compatibility such as Stony tonsillitis can effectively improve symptoms of nasal sores and restore patient health. At the same time, it provides enlightenment for the treatment of joint impediment disorders, suggesting the importance of emphasizing drug selection and compatibility in clinical practice. Through comprehensive analysis of the above theories and practices, this paper further argues the significance of syndrome differentiation and treatment in the context of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of nasal diseases.
