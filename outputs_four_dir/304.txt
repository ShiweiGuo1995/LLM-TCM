Translation
In daily life, we often encounter some minor illnesses and discomforts, such as verrucas appearing on the skin, or the use of tranquilizing medicines with heavy medicinal minerals to adjust when sleep is not good. If you feel that there is a heat condition in your body, you might as well try heat-clearing and fire-draining medicines to adjust the internal balance. The changes between bending and straightening are often reflected in pulse conditions; by observing them, you can understand your physical condition. For stomach discomfort, transforming stasis and harmonizing the stomach can effectively alleviate symptoms. Sometimes we may find subcutaneous nodules in the neck or behind the ear, which could be due to excessive dampness in the body. Although irregular malaria is not common, understanding its characteristics is helpful for early identification. And snake-shaped sores, a type of dermatosis, although sounding frightening, can recover health quickly if treated promptly. Maintaining good living habits and using these medicines appropriately will make our lives healthier and better.
