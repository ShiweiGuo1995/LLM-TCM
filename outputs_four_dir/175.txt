Translation
The dysfunction of the kidney governing water and fluids can lead to the pattern of phlegm misting the heart, manifesting symptoms such as low self-esteem. Treatment should combine clearing heat and promoting bowel movements with the clearing method; the lustre of the kidney shows in the hair, hence, kidney deficiency can also result in hair loss. Meanwhile, patients with frozen shoulder should also pay attention to regulating their kidneys to avoid alcoholic syncope, thus promoting the smooth flow of qi and blood.
