When discussing diseases caused by neither internal nor external etiological factors, we notice that in the treatment of acute conditions such as mushroom poisoning, it is important to clear and reduce gallbladder heat to expel evil influences, while simultaneously using swinging manipulation to regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach functions, promoting the reasonable application of medicinal peculiarity.
