在探讨乳发之病因病机时，需结合经络辨证与督脉证，以阐明其病理变化。小肠主液功能失调，加之暑热证所致之燥热内盛，可致体内津液耗损，引发润燥法治疗之必要。而脾恶湿，湿邪侵袭则加重病情，故临床治疗需兼顾湿邪祛除。镵针疗法在此类病症中亦有应用，以疏通经络，调和气血。综上所述，乳发之诊治需综合考量上述诸因素，方能取得良好疗效。

Translation
In exploring the causative factors and pathogenesis of acute septic mastitis, it is necessary to combine the pattern differentiation of meridians with the Du meridian pattern to elucidate its pathological changes. Dysfunction of the small intestine in governing thick body fluids, combined with the internal retention of summer heat pattern caused by summer heat syndrome, can lead to excessive dryness and internal consumption of body fluids, necessitating the application of moistening methods for treatment. Since the spleen dislikes dampness, the invasion of dampness further aggravates the condition; hence, clinical treatment should also take into account the removal of dampness. The shear needle technique also has applications in such conditions to unblock the meridians and regulate and harmonize qi and blood. In summary, the diagnosis and treatment of acute septic mastitis must comprehensively consider all these factors to achieve satisfactory therapeutic outcomes.
