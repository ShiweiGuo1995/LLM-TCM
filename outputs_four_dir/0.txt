最近有朋友问我关于汗类病的问题，其实这在中医里属于营卫不和证的一种表现，常伴有腻苔和内寒的症状。治疗时可以试试推揉法，配合舒张进针法，同时注意饮食，少吃酸味食物，以免加重肾不纳气证的情况。日常生活中也要注意保暖，避免病情加重。

Recently, a friend asked me about issues related to sweating disorders. Actually, this falls under the category of Disharmony between the Ying-nutrients and Wei-defence pattern in Traditional Chinese Medicine, often accompanied by symptoms such as greasy tongue and Internal cold. During treatment, one can try pushing-kneading manipulation, combined with skin-stretching insertion technique, while also paying attention to diet, reducing intake of sour-flavored foods to avoid exacerbating the Kidney failing to absorb qi pattern. In daily life, it's important to keep warm to prevent the condition from worsening.
