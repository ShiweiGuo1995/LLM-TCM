Translation
In exploring the pathogenesis of pediatric ancylostomiasis, we notice its main manifestations include tongue with ecchymosis/petechiae and secure the Chong meridian and stop leucorrhoea, etc. This disease not only affects the child's digestive system but also leads to dual deficiency of qi and blood, thereby manifesting as the liver being the foundation for fatigue endurance such as fatigue and weakness. In treatment, the focus is on nourishing Yin and calming the mind, supplemented by regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach to dry and harmonize, while using heat-clearing and dampness-resolving agents to resolve the heat accumulating in the urinary bladder pattern, thus achieving the purpose of treating both the tip and root.
