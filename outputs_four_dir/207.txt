最近有位朋友因为工作压力大，劳神过度，导致肝肾阴虚证，时常感到头晕目眩。我建议他采用刮（柄）法调理身体，并且调整生活习惯，避免过度劳累。同时，饮食上也要注意，少吃辛辣油腻的食物，以免加重热蕴肾证的情况。他还提到自己有时候会突然咳嗽，这可能是暴咳的表现，需要及时调理。在中医理论中，我们讲脏腑相合，通过调理脾胀来增强体质，釜底抽薪地解决根本问题。希望我的一些建议能帮助到他。

Translation
Recently, a friend of mine suffered from mental overwork due to heavy work pressure, leading to a pattern of yin deficiency of the liver and kidney, often feeling blurred vision. I suggested he adopt the handle-scraping method to regulate his body and adjust his lifestyle to avoid excessive fatigue. At the same time, he should also pay attention to his diet, eating less spicy and greasy food to prevent aggravating the condition of kidney yin deficiency. He also mentioned that he sometimes suddenly coughs, which might be a manifestation of fulminant cough and needs timely regulation. In TCM theory, we speak of Zang–fu organs mutually interconnect; by regulating spleen distension, we can enhance physical constitution and fundamentally resolve the issue. I hope my suggestions can help him.
