最近有位朋友问我，他最近总是感觉身体发热，嗓子疼得厉害，而且咳嗽不断，尤其是晚上更为明显，整个人显得很疲惫。我初步判断他是出现了气血两燔证的症状，需要及时调理。同时他的咳嗽属于内伤咳嗽，建议可以试试解表宣肺的方法，帮助缓解症状。另外，他还提到自己经常感到耳鸣，这可能与肺主通调水道有关，需要注意肺部健康。此外，他体型偏胖，平时饮食不规律，可能会出现脾虚痰阻肺证的情况，这时候可以采用刮（柄）法来促进血液循环，改善痰阻肺证的问题。希望我的建议对他有所帮助，也提醒大家平时要注意饮食和作息，保持良好的生活习惯。

Translation
Recently, a friend asked me about his recent condition where he often feels feverish, has severe sore throat, and persistent cough, especially more noticeable at night, making him feel very fatigued. I initially judged that he is showing symptoms of the pattern of heat blazing in both qi and blood phases, which requires timely regulation. At the same time, his cough belongs to the category of cough due to internal dysfunctions, and it is suggested to try the method of releasing the exterior and dispersing the lung to help alleviate the symptoms. Additionally, he mentioned frequently experiencing tinnitus, which may be related to the lung's function of regulating waterways, so attention should be paid to lung health. Moreover, his body type tends to be overweight, and his irregular diet might lead to the situation of spleen deficiency with phlegm obstructing the lung, at this point, the handle-scraping method can be used to promote blood circulation and improve the problem of phlegm obstructing the lung. I hope my suggestions will be helpful to him, and also remind everyone to pay attention to their diet and sleep, maintaining good living habits.
