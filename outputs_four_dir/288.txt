Translation
Recently, I encountered a patient who complained of liver-spleen deficiency pattern, pale facial complexion, frequent vomiting blood, yellow-reddish urine, and symptoms similar to phlegm-fluid retention. He mentioned that his constitution is weak and he often experiences tidal fever due to yin deficiency, hoping that I could provide some advice for regulation and care. I told him that maintaining good living habits and dietary habits is very important, while also paying attention to spiritual cultivation to achieve healthy body and mind. He also mentioned sometimes feeling discomfort from dental abscess, and I suggested that he pay more attention to rest in daily life and avoid overwork. Finally, I reminded him of the importance of the balance of the fluids of the five zang organs to ensure internal environmental equilibrium. I hope these suggestions will be helpful to him.
