在探讨新感温病的过程中，我们发现该病症常表现为手太阴肺经证，患者可能出现口疮等不适症状。此外，若病邪进一步发展，可能会出现肝脾气滞证，甚至引发急淋或肝胆热证，此时治疗需注重清热解毒与调理气血。值得注意的是，部分患者因饮食不当，如过量饮酒，可能导致酒癖，此症与上述病症并存时，临床表现更为复杂，需细心辨证施治。而臭田螺虽非直接病因，但其性寒湿，易助湿生痰，对于已有湿热内蕴的患者而言，应避免食用。综上所述，对新感温病的治疗需全面考虑患者体质及病情变化，灵活运用中药以达到最佳疗效。

Translation
In the exploration of new contracted warm diseases, we often find that it manifests as a Lung meridian pattern of the hand-Taiyin, with patients possibly experiencing symptoms such as mouth ulcers. Furthermore, if the pathogenic factor further develops, it may lead to a Qi stagnation pattern of the liver and spleen, and might even cause heat stranguria or liver and gallbladder heat patterns; in such cases, treatment should focus on clearing heat and removing toxins while regulating and harmonizing qi and blood. It is worth noting that some patients, due to improper diet, such as excessive alcohol consumption, may develop alcohol-induced masses, which when coexisting with the aforementioned conditions, can make clinical manifestations more complex and require careful pattern identification and treatment. Although Tinea pedis is not a direct causative factor, its nature of cold dampness easily leads to phlegm production; therefore, for patients with internal damp-heat, this food should be avoided. In summary, the treatment of new contracted warm diseases requires a comprehensive consideration of the patient's constitution and changes in the condition, and the flexible use of Chinese herbal medicines to achieve optimal therapeutic effects.
