Translation
In TCM theory, the occurrence of tremor syndrome is closely related to the deficiency of Lung Yin. During treatment, it is necessary to focus on nourishing Heart Yin and use the bilateral needle holding insertion technique to stimulate relevant acupoints for regulating and harmonizing Qi and Blood. For male infertility issues, in addition to promoting blood circulation through Tuina techniques, it is also necessary to combine with the method of supporting the Spleen and resolving Phlegm to regulate the body, achieving the effect of unblocking meridians and increasing lactation, thereby improving the overall health condition of the patient.
