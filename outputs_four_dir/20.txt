在探讨妊娠偏头痛的治疗过程中，我们发现患者伴有口苦及风眩症状，提示可能存在肝胆火旺之象。结合气虚困证与膀胱蕴热证，采用佐金平木法以调和肝肺，辅以散寒通闭之剂改善局部循环，同时针对阴癣给予清热解毒处理，整体调理以期达到标本兼治的效果。此方案在临床应用中显示出良好疗效，值得进一步研究推广。

Translation
In the treatment of migraine during pregnancy, we found that the patient presented with symptoms of a bitter taste and wind dizziness, indicating the presence of liver and gallbladder fire exuberance. Combined with Qi deficiency pattern and heat accumulating in the urinary bladder pattern, we adopted the method of reinforcing metal and inhibiting wood to harmonize the liver and lung, supplemented with agents that dissipate cold and open the orifices to improve local circulation. At the same time, for tinea cruris, we provided clear heat to detoxify treatment. Overall regulation was aimed at achieving the effect of treating both the tip and root. This plan has shown good efficacy in clinical application and is worth further research and promotion.
