Translation
This study aims to explore the similarities and differences in clinical manifestations between the patterns of Exuberant heat affecting the chest and Toxin attacking the lung defence. By observing signs such as Carphologia and Opisthotonus, combined with the characteristic of exfoliated coating in tongue manifestations, it analyzes their impact on Lung Yang and Spleen Yang Deficiency patterns. The research indicates that Pseudorubella may be closely related to the aforementioned patterns, suggesting that clinicians need to comprehensively consider the overall condition of the patient during diagnosis to improve therapeutic outcomes.
