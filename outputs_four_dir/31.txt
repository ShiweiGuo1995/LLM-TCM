Translation
When discussing the principles of TCM treatment, we often mention "unblock meridians and relieve itch" and "astringe essence and stop seminal emissions," these methods have significant effects in improving the essence and qi deficiency pattern in clinical practice. According to the theory of Six Meridians Patterns, we can more accurately identify syndromes, thus using appropriate formulas that make qi descend to treat lung system disorders caused by blood stasis due to qi deficiency, enabling patients to recover health. By deeply understanding the interactions among the Five Zang Organs, we can better apply the aforementioned therapies to achieve the purpose of treating both the tip and root.
