最近我遇到一位朋友，他总是感觉胸腹胀满不适，中医诊断为中焦积热证，建议用刮（柄）法帮助排解体内热毒。他说自己平时容易情绪紧张，导致气滞证频发，我告诉他平时可以多练习太极扇，通过舒展身体来缓解压力。他还提到晚上睡眠质量不高，经常出现死脉，中医认为这可能是正水引起的问题，需要注意饮食调理。另外，他经常感到神气鼓荡，好像身体里的能量无法安定下来，医生说这是阴阳失衡的表现，需要通过辛温发汗的方法来调整体质。希望我的分享能帮助大家更好地理解这些中医术语，并在日常生活中加以运用。

Translation
Recently, I met a friend who always feels fullness and discomfort in the chest and abdomen. According to TCM diagnosis, it is the pattern of excess heat in the spleen and stomach (middle jiao), and it is suggested to use the handle-scraping method to help eliminate internal heat toxicity. He mentioned that he tends to be emotionally tense, leading to frequent occurrences of qi stagnation pattern. I advised him to practice Taiji fan regularly, which can help relieve stress by stretching the body. He also mentioned that his sleep quality is poor at night, often experiencing a strange pulse, which TCM considers may be due to generalized edema, and dietary adjustments need to be noted. Additionally, he often feels shen-qi movement, as if the energy inside his body cannot settle down, doctors say this is a manifestation of yin-yang imbalance, and it needs to be adjusted through the method of promoting sweating with pungent-warm. I hope my sharing can help everyone better understand these TCM terms and apply them in daily life.
