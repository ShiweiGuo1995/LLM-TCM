在探讨五脏之间的相互关系时，我们发现疏邪透表是治疗外感疾病的重要方法之一。对于伴有胆热症状的患者，采用清泄胆热的方法可以有效缓解病情。在临床实践中，我们运用夹持进针法促进药物吸收，同时通过燥化痰和行气降逆来调节体内环境，以达到治疗目的。此外，对于血虚体质的患者，合理使用补血药也是不可或缺的一环。这些治疗方法体现了中医理论中体用的哲学思想，即整体与局部的统一，共同维护人体健康。

Translation
In exploring the mutual relationships among the Five Zang organs, we find that removing pathogenic factors and releasing the exterior is one of the important methods for treating exogenous diseases. For patients with symptoms of gallbladder heat, clearing and reducing gallbladder heat can effectively alleviate the condition. In clinical practice, we use needle-holding insertion with both hands to promote drug absorption, while simultaneously regulating the internal environment through drying phlegm and circulating and down-regulating Qi to achieve therapeutic goals. Additionally, for patients with blood deficiency constitution, reasonably using blood-tonifying medicines is an indispensable part. These treatment methods embody the philosophical concept of Taiji functions in Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, which emphasizes the unity of the whole and its parts to jointly maintain human health.
