Translation
In the treatment of spleen deficiency with food retention pattern, the application of emetic formulas should be used with caution to avoid damaging healthy qi. Meanwhile, based on the theory of the pairing between the heart and small intestine, we explore how to achieve the effect of reinforcing the kidney and securing the fetus by adjusting diet and lifestyle habits. Clinical observations show that belching and hiccups often occur simultaneously, which may be due to dysfunction of the spleen and stomach. In daily life, appropriate cosmetic tuina can not only promote blood circulation but also alleviate the aforementioned symptoms. For patients with cholelithiasis, in addition to drug therapy, a reasonable dietary structure and lifestyle are equally important. In summary, through comprehensive regulation, these conditions can be effectively improved.
