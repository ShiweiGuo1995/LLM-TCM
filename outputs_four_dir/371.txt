Translation
In the treatment of Paragonimiasis, we commonly use the Clearing method and Sinking and descending medicines to eliminate the Pathogenic qi within the body, alleviating inflammation. At the same time, by clearing the zang-fu organs to reduce interior heat, we adjust the internal environment to prevent Fire from flaring upward. In this process, the properties of Ascending, descending, floating, and sinking of the herbs are particularly important, and suitable drugs should be selected based on the condition to achieve the purpose of maintaining central equilibrium, thereby improving symptoms of Tympanites and restoring the health of the body.
