This study aims to explore the treatment strategies for patients with the Warm Dryness Damaging the Lung Pattern who exhibit symptoms of thirst without desire to drink. Clinical observations have revealed that such patients often present with signs of xerosis, indicating a deficiency of body fluids. Based on this, the method of nourishing yin and calming the mind is adopted, supplemented by neutral-property medicines to regulate, aiming to harmonize Ying-nutrient blood and restore yin-yang balance. Further analysis indicates that for patients with Yin and Yang Deficiency Pattern, astringent lung and relieving cough drugs should be combined to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and root. In summary, for the treatment of patients with the Warm Dryness Damaging the Lung Pattern, it is essential to emphasize both nourishing yin and moistening dryness as well as harmonizing Ying-nutrient blood, while also considering astringent lung and relieving cough, in order to achieve good therapeutic effects.
