This article aims to explore the manifestations of blood stasis due to qi deficiency in the disease of Paediatric ancylostomiasis and its treatment strategies. Patients with Paediatric ancylostomiasis often exhibit a sallow facial complexion and emaciation, which are caused by poor circulation of Ying-nutrient within the vessels. Through clinical observation, it has been found that using plucking manipulation to stimulate the bladder meridian of foot-Taiyang, combined with nourishing the heart and lung, can effectively improve the circulation of qi and blood, alleviate symptoms of anger causing the qi to rise, and simultaneously use products that widen the middle and promote diuresis to achieve the purpose of harmonizing yin and yang and restoring health. Studies have shown that the comprehensive application of the aforementioned methods can significantly enhance therapeutic effects, providing a new treatment approach for patients with Paediatric ancylostomiasis.
