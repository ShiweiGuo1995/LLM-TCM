This article aims to explore the clinical manifestations and treatment strategies for patients with chickenpox caused by pathogenic warmth during spring. The study found that the pulse conditions of such patients present as wiry pulse in spring, indicating overabundance of Liver qi. In treatment, scalp acupuncture is used to regulate and harmonize qi and blood, and methods to open the orifices and unblock impediments are employed to improve symptoms in the head. Meanwhile, considering that some cases are accompanied by fluid retention in the lungs, the method of draining the lung and expelling retained fluids is proposed to alleviate local symptoms. Furthermore, for patients whose condition progresses to the late stage and exhibits signs of deficiency collapse, one must be wary of the critical condition known as false spirit, and timely measures should be taken to prevent bone lesions and other complications. In summary, the comprehensive use of the aforementioned methods can effectively enhance clinical efficacy.
