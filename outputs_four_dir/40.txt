This article aims to explore the relationship between hiccups and the Taiyang pattern, combining clinical practice analysis to propose a method that integrates lifting the anus technique with assistant tuina tools to achieve the purpose of clearing heat in the lung and stomach. At the same time, for patients with erratic dysentery, the use of the method of harmonizing the middle is adopted to regulate internal balance, emphasizing the importance of the liver storing blood, in order to provide new ideas for clinical treatment. The research results show that the comprehensive application of the above methods has significant effects on improving patient symptoms.
