最近有朋友问我关于身体的小毛病，比如说发瘤和囊虫病，其实这些都是因为体内气血不畅造成的。在治疗上，我们常常采用活血祛风的方法，来缓解这些症状。记得有句话说“一身备五弓”，说的是人体就像一张弓，五脏六腑就像是弦，任何一个地方出现问题都会影响到整体。如果出现实寒证，我们需要解表攻里，同时对于一些太阳蓄血证的情况，也要注意清心利水，这样才能达到标本兼治的效果。

Translation
Recently, a friend asked me about minor ailments of the body, such as effusion and cysticercosis. In fact, these are all caused by stagnation of qi and blood within the body. In treatment, we often adopt the method of circulating blood and eliminating wind to alleviate these symptoms. There is a saying that "five bows exist in the body," which means that the human body is like a bow, with the five zang organs and six fu organs being the strings; any problem in one area will affect the whole. If there is an excess cold pattern, we need to release the exterior and purge the interior. At the same time, for some cases of Taiyang blood retention pattern, it is also necessary to clear the heart and induce urination, so as to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and root.
