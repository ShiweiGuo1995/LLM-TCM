在研究过程中，我们发现痰热闭肺证患者在接受水制治疗后症状有所改善，而消食导滞剂则对改善其消化系统功能具有积极作用。此外，对于癌症患者的治疗，祛化浊法能够有效缓解体内湿浊状态，结合弦脉的观察有助于更准确地判断病情。值得注意的是，尽管肾垂体在调节人体生理机能方面起着关键作用，但在本次讨论中并未直接涉及该器官的具体应用。太极刀作为一种独特的治疗方法，在临床实践中展现出了潜在的应用价值，但其具体机制仍需进一步探讨。

In the course of our research, we found that patients with the pattern of phlegm heat obstructing the lung experienced symptom improvement after water processing treatment, while formulas that promote digestion and unblock stagnation showed a positive effect on improving their digestive system functions. Additionally, for the treatment of carcinoma cancer patients, the method of resolving turbidity proved effective in alleviating internal dampness and turbidity states; combining this with the observation of string-like pulse helped in more accurately assessing the condition. It is noteworthy that although the kidney prolapse plays a crucial role in regulating human physiological functions, this organ's specific applications were not directly involved in this discussion. As a unique therapeutic approach, Taiji broadsword has demonstrated potential clinical application value, but its specific mechanisms still require further exploration.
