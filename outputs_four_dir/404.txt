Translation
In discussing the principles of TCM treatment, we often mention the issue of phlegm-dampness obstruction and cold essence leading to infertility, which usually involves the pattern of Qi stagnation of the liver and spleen. By using formulas that tonify Qi and blood-circulating and blood stasis-resolving medicines, we can effectively regulate the body's Qi and Blood, improving such symptoms. At the same time, when dealing with external invasion syndromes, reinforce healthy Qi and release the exterior is one of the commonly used methods. For patients with sleep disorders, methods that calm the mind with heavy medicinal minerals should be employed. It is noteworthy that certain special therapies like Fast Yi Zhi Chan pushing manipulation also have their unique therapeutic effects. These methods each have their focus in clinical practice, but their common goal is to restore the balance of the body.
