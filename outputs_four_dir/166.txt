Translation
Lower back pain often arises due to Qi sinking, and when seen with the Five Retardations, particular attention should be given to insufficient Gallbladder Qi and impaired flow in the divergent meridians. Treatment should employ formulas that regulate Qi to harmonize and balance Qi and Blood, combined with methods to kill parasitic worms and calm the mind, so as to ensure the swift pulse is unobstructed, and all symptoms will resolve on their own.
