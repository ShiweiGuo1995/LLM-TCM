产后血崩需重视，常因胎毒蕴结证所致，治疗时臣药不可少，通因通用法为佳。若病情危急，则关乎命关，须及时诊治。舌诊可见肿胀舌，乃体内湿热之象，募穴刺激有助于调理。而龟背痰虽罕见，亦需警惕其对产妇健康的潜在威胁。

Translation
Postpartum metrorrhagia should be given serious attention, often caused by the fetal toxin and heat accumulation pattern. When treating, minister medicines cannot be dispensed with; it is best to use the method of treating uncontrolled discharge by unblocking. If the condition is critical, it concerns the life pass, and timely treatment is required. Tongue diagnosis can reveal a swollen tongue, indicating internal damp-heat. Stimulating front-Mu points is helpful for regulation. Although tortoise-back phlegm is rare, its potential threat to the health of postpartum women should not be overlooked.
