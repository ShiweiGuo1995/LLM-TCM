Translation
This article aims to explore the correlation between impaired qi activity and Shaoyang headache, and proposes a treatment plan based on warming the meridians and dissipating cold, combined with clinical practice. Through detailed observation of the menstruation pulse, it is found that abnormal changes occur when qi activity is impaired, which serves as the basis for using formulas that warm the interior. The article also mentions deep-rooted ulcers and pediatric pinworm infections; although their locations differ, both require focusing on harmonizing yin and yang to be effective. Taijiquan structure, as an auxiliary therapy, also has unique effects in regulating qi activity and alleviating Shaoyang headache. In summary, impaired qi activity is closely related to Shaoyang headache. Using the method of warming the meridians and dissipating cold along with formulas that warm the interior, and supplemented by Taijiquan exercises, can effectively improve the condition.
