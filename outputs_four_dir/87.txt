In exploring the treatment strategies for Yin fluids deficiency pattern and Stasis and heat entering the meridians pattern, we found that the application of Minor formulas has significant effects. Especially in treating Yin fluids deficiency pattern, by combining Tonify qi and astringe the breast milk with Warm and transform cold phlegm, we can effectively improve patient symptoms. Additionally, for Stasis and heat entering the meridians pattern, using formulas that warm and transform cold phlegm also achieves good therapeutic outcomes. Meanwhile, in clinical practice, Daoyin (guiding and stretching) as an auxiliary treatment method plays a crucial role in promoting the recovery of patients with Cysticercosis. In summary, reasonably applying the aforementioned methods and medications can better serve the health needs of patients.
