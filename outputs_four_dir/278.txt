Translation
In TCM, it is believed that wind floats and ascends, easily leading to a heat pattern. Clinically, this is commonly seen in patients with gynecomastia, where the form of the tongue changes significantly and floating collaterals are evident. Treatment should focus on transforming stasis and unblocking collaterals, improving local blood circulation. The medicine should be taken warm to help enhance its efficacy, especially after summer heat stroke, when this method is more appropriate.
