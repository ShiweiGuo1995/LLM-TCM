Translation
Paediatric epidemic toxin dysentery often results from external invasion of damp-heat pathogenic factors and internal injury due to improper diet, leading to disharmony of spleen and stomach with impaired transformation and transportation. If the condition persists, it may lead to the marrow deficiency pattern; treatment should focus on tonifying Yang and circulating Qi while regulating the balance of Stomach qi, spirit, and root. Additionally, for skin conditions such as Scabies, attention should be paid to regulating and harmonizing Ying nutrients and Wei defence to enhance the body's resistance. If the blood accumulation in the bladder pattern occurs, timely pattern differentiation and treatment should be conducted to prevent the condition from worsening.
