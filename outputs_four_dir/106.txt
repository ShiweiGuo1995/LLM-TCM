Translation
In spring, as the weather warms up, but the coldness has not completely receded, we need to pay attention to preventing frostbite. Diet should be light, avoiding overly spicy and stimulating foods to prevent the invasion of the six excesses. Recently, I have found that some people are experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort, which might be due to the pattern of wind damaging intestinal collaterals; it is recommended to adjust in time. Children should pay attention to balanced nutrition to avoid the occurrence of eczematous carcinoma of the nipple. Additionally, remember to deworm regularly to prevent taeniasis. In daily life, we should learn to regulate qi and resolve masses, maintaining good living habits. If symptoms of yang syncope appear, seek medical treatment promptly. By these methods, we can better maintain our health.
