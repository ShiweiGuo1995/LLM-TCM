在探讨男性不育的问题时，我们需关注肾在志为恐这一理论，通过平刺足少阴肾经以调节情绪，缓解因情志不畅导致的生殖系统疾病。肾生髓，肾功能的强弱直接影响到人体的生长发育和生殖健康，对于热实结胸证和风热夹杂证，中医认为它们与体内阴阳失衡有关，治疗上不仅要清热解毒，还需注重补肾固精。此外，在治疗过程中，若出现大量出汗等亡阴症状，需及时采取措施补充阴液，维持机体平衡。

Translation
In discussing male sterility, we should focus on the theory that the emotion of the kidney is fear, using subcutaneous needle insertion along the kidney meridian of foot-Shaoyin to regulate emotions and alleviate reproductive system diseases caused by emotional stagnation. The kidney generates marrow; the strength of kidney function directly affects human growth, development, and reproductive health. For the exuberant heat affecting the chest pattern and wind-heat mixed pattern, Traditional Chinese Medicine considers them related to the imbalance of Yin and Yang in the body. Treatment not only involves clearing heat and removing toxins but also emphasizes replenishing the kidney and consolidating essence. Additionally, during treatment, if symptoms such as profuse sweating indicating Yin depletion occur, timely measures should be taken to replenish Yin fluids and maintain the balance of the body.
