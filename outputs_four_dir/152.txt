In daily life, we often experience excessive joy damaging the heart due to emotional fluctuations; at this time, we can adjust our mood through the posture of sinking the chest and raising the back. For patients with sterility disorders, appropriate tonifying yang and removing or transforming phlegm can help improve physical constitution. When cooking, we can try roasting the ingredients, which not only enhances the deliciousness but also better preserves the efficacy of the herbs. Additionally, if one feels the symptom of warts, it may be a manifestation of insufficiency of marrow within the body, at this time, dietary therapy is needed for supplementation. In the process of health preservation, we should learn to apply these methods to make life healthier and more harmonious.
