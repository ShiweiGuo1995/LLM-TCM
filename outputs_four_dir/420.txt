在中医诊断中，切脉是判断疾病的重要方法之一，通过切脉可以了解体内气血运行的情况。对于蛊胀病症，我们常采用宣散浊气的方法来治疗，同时配合辛温发汗以促进体表邪气的排出。血风劳是一种慢性消耗性疾病，治疗上需要注重调养气血，防止余沥不尽的发生。而在处理石疽时，则需结合内外治法，既要清热解毒，又要活血化瘀，确保病情得到全面控制。肺藏魄，故肺部疾病的治疗也极为重要，需注重调理肺功能，以达到整体平衡。

Translation
In TCM diagnosis, pulse diagnosis is one of the important methods for judging diseases, through which we can understand the condition of Qi and Blood circulation inside the body. For tympanites disorder, we often adopt the method of expelling turbid Qi, while also promoting sweating with pungent-warm to facilitate the elimination of pathogenic Qi from the body surface. Postpartum exhaustion is a chronic debilitating disease; in treatment, it is essential to focus on nourishing Qi and Blood and preventing dribbling urination. In dealing with stony gangrene, both internal and external therapies should be combined, clearing heat and removing toxins as well as circulating blood and eliminating stasis to ensure comprehensive control of the condition. Since the Lung stores the Corporeal Soul (Po), the treatment of lung diseases is also extremely important, requiring attention to regulating lung function to achieve overall balance.
