Translation
Paediatric cysticercosis in TCM treatment is mostly approached by regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach, yellowish facial complexion is one of its common symptoms, indicating the possible presence of damp-heat or vacuity heat. According to the principle of treating deficiency with reinforcement, we adopt formulas that clear deficiency heat to harmonize Yin-Yang balance, while combining tongue acupuncture therapy to stimulate specific points, achieving the effect of eliminating stasis and regenerating blood, thus improving the child's physique. Additionally, excessive joy damages the heart should also be noted; maintaining emotional comfort is equally important for disease recovery. The moistening and draining downward method is helpful in promoting the discharge of internal dampness, further consolidating therapeutic effects.
