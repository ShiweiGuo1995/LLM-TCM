Original Text
在日常生活中，我们常常会遇到一些小病小痛，比如皮肤上的小伤口，我们可以采用一些敛疮止痛的方法来缓解。同时，如果出现消化不良的情况，养阴和胃的食疗方法可以帮助我们调理身体。但有时，我们会遇到更为复杂的症状，如气血两燔证，这时就需要及时就医，以免病情加重。另外，如果感到胸闷气短，可能是中焦虚热症的表现，这时候需要清热解毒，调养脾胃。对于情绪不畅，肝气郁结的朋友，化瘀疏肝的中药可以帮助他们恢复健康。当然，有些情况下我们需要使用峻下逐水药来排除体内湿气，但是这类药物性质强烈，需在医生指导下使用。在寒冷季节，温补心肺的食疗方可以增强体质，预防疾病。最后，如果突然出现呼吸困难，口唇青紫等症状，可能就是肺厥，这是非常危险的，必须立即就医。

Translation
In daily life, we often encounter some minor ailments, such as small wounds on the skin. We can alleviate them by using methods to astringe sores and stop pain. At the same time, if there is indigestion, dietary therapy to nourish Yin and benefit the stomach can help us regulate our body. However, sometimes we may encounter more complex symptoms, such as the Heat blazing in both Qi and Blood phases pattern, at which point it is necessary to seek medical attention promptly to prevent the condition from worsening. Additionally, if one feels chest tightness and shortness of breath, it might be a manifestation of the Yin deficiency of the spleen and stomach pattern, and at this time, it is necessary to clear heat to detoxify and regulate the spleen and stomach. For friends with obstructed emotions and Liver qi stagnation, Chinese herbal medicines to transform stasis and soothe the liver can help them recover their health. Of course, in some cases, we need to use drastic water-expelling medicines to eliminate dampness within the body, but these drugs are potent and should only be used under the guidance of a doctor. In cold seasons, food therapy to warm and tonify the heart and lung can enhance physical constitution and prevent diseases. Finally, if sudden symptoms such as difficulty breathing and bluish, purple lips appear, it could be pulmonary syncope, which is very dangerous and must be treated immediately.
