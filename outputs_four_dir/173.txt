最近在跟一位朋友聊天时，他跟我提到最近总是感觉身体不适，尤其是经常出现虚脉的现象，而且还有妊娠呕吐的症状，我怀疑他是小肠主化物的功能出现了问题。另外，他的鼻子也一直不太舒服，好像得了鼻渊一样，有时候还会感觉到咽喉菌带来的不适。更严重的是，他有一次喝酒后竟然出现了酒厥的情况，差点出了意外。我建议他赶紧去医院检查一下，同时也要注意出针的调理，以免症状加重。希望我的一些建议能帮助到他。

Recently, while chatting with a friend, he mentioned that he has been feeling unwell recently, especially experiencing the phenomenon of deficient pulse frequently, and also having symptoms of morning sickness. I suspect that his function of 'The small intestine governs transforming' may be problematic. Additionally, his nose has been uncomfortable for some time, as if he had nasal sinusitis, and sometimes he feels discomfort caused by throat cancer. More seriously, after drinking alcohol once, he experienced alcoholic syncope, nearly resulting in an accident. I advised him to go to the hospital for a check-up as soon as possible, and also to pay attention to needle withdrawal adjustment to prevent the condition from worsening. I hope my suggestions can help him.
