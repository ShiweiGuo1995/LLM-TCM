最近天气转凉，不少朋友出现了月经过少的情况，这可能是由于体内寒湿过重导致的。中医认为心其华在面，如果面色苍白，可能是因为气血不足。而我最近遇到的一个案例是关于冬温病的，患者起初只是觉得身体发热，却没想到是热证，后来发展成了肠痨，真是令人担忧。治疗时发现，他还有痰蕴脾证的症状，需要调理脾胃，化痰祛湿。另外，还有一位患者因为长期熬夜，导致虚实真假难辨，肺主治节失调，出现了咳嗽不止的现象。这些情况都提醒我们，日常生活中要注意调养身体，保持良好的生活习惯。

Translation
Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, many friends have experienced scanty menstruation, which may be due to excessive internal cold and dampness. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, it is believed that the lustre of the heart shows in the face; if the facial complexion is pale, it might be because of insufficient qi and blood. A recent case I encountered was about winter pestilence; initially, the patient felt only fever, without realizing it was a heat pattern, but later it developed into intestinal tuberculosis, truly causing concern. Upon treatment, it was found that he also had symptoms of phlegm蕴脾, requiring regulation and harmonization of the spleen and stomach, and transformation and elimination of phlegm and dampness. Additionally, another patient, due to prolonged熬夜, led to difficulty in distinguishing true or false deficiency and excess, with disordered lung governing management and regulation, resulting in persistent coughing. These situations all remind us that in our daily lives, we need to pay attention to nourishing the body and maintaining good living habits.
