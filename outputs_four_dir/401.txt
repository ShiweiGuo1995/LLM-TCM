Translation
In TCM, it is believed that during autumn, the dryness Qi prevails, easily injuring lung jin, leading to autumn dryness. At this time, it is particularly important to regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach. Circulating qi and harmonizing the stomach can promote the transformation function of the spleen and stomach, ensuring smooth stomach qi; while blood failing to flow within the vessels may cause various bleeding symptoms, which need to be resolved through regulating qi and harmonizing blood. The function of the贲门(carding gate) is closely related to stomach qi; its dysfunction will affect food digestion. Meanwhile, for patients with wasting of the lower jiao (wasting kidney), calming and settling the mind to adjust emotions is also crucial for disease recovery. During the treatment process, one must master the eight requirements, comprehensively regulating bodily functions to achieve the purpose of treating diseases.
