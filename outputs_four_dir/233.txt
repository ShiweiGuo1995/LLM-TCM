Translation
Recently, I encountered a patient who always felt palpitations and was restless, with protruding tongue and unceasing head shaking, which made me think of the state of "Yin within Yang". His appetite was also poor, suffering from loss of appetite, and his voice was very small and faint. Although he felt thirsty, he did not want to drink water. After diagnosis, it was found that he had the condition of Liver qi deficiency. The treatment needed comprehensive regulation.
