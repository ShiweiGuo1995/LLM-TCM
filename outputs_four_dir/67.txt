This article explores the treatment strategies for parasitic disorders, employing the method of transforming stasis and unblocking collaterals to improve the circulation of qi and blood, combined with the use of astringent formulas and sinking and descending medicines for regulation. At the same time, the condition is assessed through observing the patient's tongue manifestations such as rough coating. In terms of treatment methods, in addition to oral medication, mild-warm moxibustion is also used to warm and unblock meridians and alleviate symptoms characterized by flaming upward. Furthermore, for certain specific cases, appropriate application of hooking manipulation is employed to assist in treatment, aiming to comprehensively enhance therapeutic effects. Research shows that the comprehensive use of the aforementioned methods can effectively increase the clinical cure rate of parasitic disorders.
