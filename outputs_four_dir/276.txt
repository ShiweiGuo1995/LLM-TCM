Translation
Recently, I encountered a patient in the clinic who had been suffering from amenorrhea for a long time. Through pattern identification, it was discovered that this was due to a combined deficiency and excess pattern. During the treatment process, we adopted methods of circulating blood and eliminating stasis as well as transforming stasis and unblocking collaterals. Meanwhile, according to her constitution, corresponding acupuncture points were selected for acupuncture adjustment, achieving remarkable results. Another friend consulted me due to gonorrhea. After diagnosis, it was found that this was caused by retained placenta, requiring timely adjustment of spleen yang deficiency with water retention pattern to prevent further development of the condition. It is hoped that these experience shares can help everyone better understand the treatment methods and principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
