By observing and analyzing clinical cases, this article explores the application value of comprehensive analysis on pulse and symptoms in diagnosing sexual obsessions, and further elaborates on the pathogenesis of pestilential jaundice under two pathological conditions: phlegm blocking the lung pattern and phlegm accumulating in the lung pattern. The study found that the existence of wind heat affecting the meridians pattern and excessive worry damaging spirit qi pattern has a significant impact on the development of the condition during treatment. In addition, the article also discusses the pathological manifestations of fleshy tumors under certain circumstances and their relationship with the aforementioned patterns, providing theoretical basis for clinical practice.
