Translation
In the scorching summer, when summer dampness prevails, many friends may experience symptoms of the pattern of summer heat consuming qi and fluids. At this time, we can adjust with Chinese herbal medicines, but it is necessary to pay attention to the spoilage of Chinese medicines. During treatment, we can adopt the method of pungent opening and bitter descending while also balancing and regulating cold and heat. For some friends with more severe conditions, methods such as draining downward or lifting and securing qi may be needed to improve their symptoms. If there are issues with the flow of meridians and collaterals, massage of the eight confluent points can be considered to alleviate them, which also has certain auxiliary therapeutic effects for the pattern of stasis and heat entering the meridians. In daily life, maintaining good living habits, reasonable diet, and appropriate exercise is key to preventing these patterns.
