本文旨在探讨胃热气逆证与中焦实热证在临床上的鉴别诊断，结合悬癖与秋燥之症，分析其病机及演变规律。文中指出，胃气虚证与肾虚证互为因果，常导致阴阳失调，病情复杂。此外，对无头疽的治疗亦需考虑上述诸证的影响，以期达到标本兼治的效果。通过临床案例分析，进一步验证了该理论体系的实用性和科学性。

Translation
This article aims to explore the differential diagnosis of the pattern of heat-induced ascending of stomach qi and excess heat in the spleen and stomach pattern in clinical practice, combined with the analysis of masses in the sub-costal region and autumn dryness syndrome, examining their pathogenesis and evolution patterns. The article points out that the pattern of stomach qi deficiency and kidney deficiency pattern are intercausal, often leading to disharmony between yin and yang and complex conditions. Additionally, the treatment of headless abscess also needs to consider the influence of the aforementioned patterns to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and root. Through clinical case analysis, the practicality and scientific nature of this theoretical system have been further verified.
