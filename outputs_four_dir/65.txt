This study aims to explore the clinical manifestations and treatment strategies of Earth personality constitution in the patterns of exuberant heat in the heart and lung and Lung yin deficiency. Research on patients with insomnia has found that such patients often exhibit abnormal hair as an extension of blood, indicating dysfunction of heart and lung functions. During the treatment process, the method of removing toxins and resolving swelling was used to improve local symptoms, combined with the principle of flexible hands to adjust the constitution, aiming to achieve Yin-Yang balance. At the same time, the changes in pulse conditions were closely monitored, and strange pulses were promptly identified to assess disease progression and treatment effectiveness. The study shows that the comprehensive use of the above methods can effectively alleviate clinical symptoms and improve patient quality of life.
