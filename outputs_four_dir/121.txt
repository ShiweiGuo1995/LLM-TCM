同名经配穴法是中医针灸治疗中的重要方法之一，通过选取同名经上的穴位进行治疗。比如，在温病治疗过程中，我们可以采用此法配合使用补阳药来增强疗效。同时，根据患者的具体情况，我们还可以选择使用直刺或留罐法以达到更好的治疗效果。值得注意的是，心其华在面，说明面部皮肤状态与心脏健康密切相关，因此在治疗时也需关注面部的变化。此外，手太阳小肠经和同岁会也是我们在临床实践中常用的几个概念，它们在整体治疗方案中发挥着不可替代的作用。

Translation
The method of point combination of the same-name meridians is one of the important methods in acupuncture treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. By selecting acupoints on the same-name meridians for treatment, we can achieve therapeutic effects. For instance, during the treatment of warm diseases, we can use this method in conjunction with Yang-tonifying medicines to enhance efficacy. At the same time, based on the patient's specific condition, we can choose to use perpendicular needle insertion or cup retention to achieve better therapeutic outcomes. It is worth noting that the lustre of the heart shows in the face, indicating that the facial skin condition is closely related to heart health; therefore, changes in the face should also be taken into consideration during treatment. Additionally, the small intestine meridian of hand-Taiyang and identical annual congruence are several concepts we commonly use in clinical practice, and they play an irreplaceable role in the overall treatment plan.
