Translation
In daily life, we often encounter some seemingly ordinary situations that hide health risks, such as restlessness caused by the pathogenic fire pattern or the feeling of heaviness due to water retention obstructing the flow of qi. At such times, it might be helpful to try the ten formula types of Traditional Chinese Medicine for conditioning, which can help clear the head and eyes, making one's spirit more invigorated. If a child has sunken fontanels, it may be due to insufficiency of the spirit, requiring careful nurturing. In the face of dampness pestilence, greater emphasis should be placed on prevention, maintaining good living habits, and avoiding the invasion of external pathogenic qi. Meanwhile, pay attention to changes in the hollow pulse, which is an indicator of the body's health status. Through these simple methods of conditioning, we can better protect our own and our family's health.
