最近天气变化无常，我接诊了一位患者，他因为饮食不当引发了阳明腑实证，腹部胀痛，便秘严重。另外还有一位患者，她出现了胞肿如桃的症状，询问后得知是因为水气凌心证导致的心慌气短。我还遇到了一些患者，他们患上了温疫，症状表现为发热、咳嗽和秽浊，需要及时调理。此外，我建议大家日常生活中要注意饮食健康，避免食用过多油腻食物，以防菜乌紫病的发生。最后，我要提醒大家，如果出现中风的前兆，如突然口眼歪斜，半身不遂，一定要及时就医，不可拖延。在治疗过程中，我会采用恢刺等方法帮助患者恢复健康。

Translation
Recently, the weather has been unpredictable. I saw a patient who developed an excess Yangming–fu organ pattern due to improper diet, presenting with abdominal distending pain and severe constipation. Another patient had inflammatory eyelid disorder, with symptoms like swollen eyelids resembling peaches, and upon inquiry, it was found that this was caused by the Water retention affecting the heart pattern leading to palpitations and shortness of breath. I also encountered several patients suffering from epidemic febrile disorders, showing symptoms such as fever, cough, and foul turbidity, requiring timely adjustment. Additionally, I advise everyone to pay attention to dietary health in daily life, avoiding excessive consumption of greasy foods to prevent the occurrence of pickles cyanosis. Finally, I must remind everyone that if signs of wind stroke appear, such as sudden facial deviation and hemiplegia, they should seek medical attention immediately without delay. In the treatment process, I will use methods such as relaxing needling to help patients recover.
