在中医理论中，卫行脉外的气与邪气相互作用是导致疾病的重要因素之一。例如，瘾疹的发生往往与外界风邪侵袭有关，治疗时需要通过解表攻下来驱除体表的邪气。同时，观察舌象中的染苔变化可以判断疾病的性质和进展，如湿热内蕴常表现为黄腻苔。在诊断过程中，我们还需关注患者的整体状况，包括阴阳平衡及五化状态。例如，阴虚火旺的患者可能会出现舌红少津，治疗上需注重滋阴降火。此外，开呼合吸的呼吸调养也是辅助治疗的重要环节，有助于改善肺功能，促进气血运行。

Translation
In TCM theory, the Qi of Wei-defence circulating outside the vessels interacts with pathogenic qi, which is one of the important factors leading to disease. For example, the occurrence of urticaria is often related to the invasion of external pathogenic wind; treatment needs to be carried out by releasing the exterior and purging the interior to expel the pathogenic factors from the body surface. At the same time, observing changes in the stained coating on the tongue can determine the nature and progression of the disease; for instance, internal damp-heat often manifests as a yellow greasy tongue coating. In the diagnostic process, we also need to pay attention to the patient's overall condition, including the balance of Yin-Yang and the state of the Five transformations. For example, patients with Yin deficiency leading to fire hyperactivity may present with a red tongue with little thin fluids, and treatment should focus on nourishing and supplementing yin fluids and reducing fire. Additionally, opening with breathing out and closing with breathing in in respiratory regulation is also an important part of auxiliary treatment, which helps improve lung function and promote the circulation of Qi and Blood.
