最近有位朋友跟我诉苦说他总是单腹胀，感觉腹部胀满不适，这在中医看来可能是因为决渎之官不畅所致。我告诉他日常生活中要注意饮食习惯，避免过食寒凉食物，因为寒者热之，调整体质才是根本。他还提到有时候会感觉身体不适，好像有四两拨千斤的感觉，我分析可能是由于心肝血瘀证导致的，建议他可以适当做一些促进血液循环的运动。另外，他最近工作压力大，经常熬夜，导致伤津，出现口干舌燥的症状，这也加重了他的症状，尤其是出现了重舌的情况，这些都是需要我们重视的。希望我的建议能帮助到他，也提醒大家在生活中要注意调养身体，五行相侮，保持良好的生活习惯。

Translation
Recently, a friend complained to me that he always felt distension in his abdomen, feeling full and uncomfortable. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this might be due to the dysfunction of the dredging and draining organ. I advised him to pay attention to his dietary habits in daily life, avoiding excessive consumption of cold foods, because cold should be treated with warmth, and adjusting his constitution is fundamental. He also mentioned that sometimes he feels unwell, as if with the strength of four ounces one can move a thousand jin (a traditional Chinese unit of weight). I analyzed that it might be caused by the blood stasis pattern in the heart and liver, and suggested that he could appropriately engage in exercises that promote blood circulation. Additionally, he has been under great work pressure recently, often staying up late, leading to damage to thin body fluids, resulting in symptoms such as dry mouth and tongue, which exacerbate his condition, especially the appearance of lotus tongue, all of which need our attention. I hope my suggestions will help him, and remind everyone to pay attention to nurturing their bodies in daily life, maintaining the balance of the five elements, and keeping good living habits.
