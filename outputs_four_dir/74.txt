在探讨夏季常见疾病时，我们常遇到因疰夏导致的筋痹症状，此症与营卫不和密切相关。治疗上，需重视相兼脉的诊断，通过络刺等方法促进气血流通。同时，风化热证亦不容忽视，其与疰夏症状交织，使得病情更为复杂。针对脾胃虚弱患者，健脾驱虫法是必要的辅助手段，以增强体质，抵御瘴气病的侵袭。在临床实践中，综合运用上述方法，方能有效缓解患者的不适症状。

Translation
In discussing common diseases in summer, we often encounter sinew impediment symptoms caused by summer non-acclimatization, which is closely related to disharmony between the Ying-nutrients and Wei-defence. In treatment, it is necessary to focus on the diagnosis of combined pulses, promoting the circulation of Qi and Blood through methods such as collateral needling. At the same time, heat patterns should not be overlooked, as they intertwine with summer non-acclimatization symptoms, making the condition more complex. For patients with spleen and stomach weakness, fortifying the spleen and repelling parasitic worms is a necessary auxiliary method to enhance physical constitution and resist the invasion of miasmatic disorders. In clinical practice, the effective alleviation of patients' discomfort symptoms can only be achieved by comprehensively applying the above methods.
