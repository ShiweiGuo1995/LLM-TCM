在本次研究中，我们探讨了实寒证与瘀阻胞宫证在妇科疾病中的表现及治疗策略，结合现代医学检查手段，我们发现此类患者常伴有🗎热下注证导致的外痔症状，治疗上需谨慎使用峻下逐水药以免伤正气。此外，对于同时患有心肝阴虚证的患者，采用桑枝棒配合针灸疗法可以有效缓解肺风痰喘的症状，进一步提高临床疗效。研究表明，综合辨证施治是改善上述复杂病情的关键。

Translation
In this study, we explored the manifestations and treatment strategies of excess cold pattern and blood stasis obstructing the uterus pattern in gynecological diseases. Combining modern medical examination methods, we found that such patients often present with symptoms of damp heat downflow pattern leading to external hemorrhoids. In treatment, drastic water-expelling medicines should be used cautiously to avoid injuring healthy qi. Additionally, for patients also suffering from yin deficiency of the heart and liver pattern, using mulberry branch stick combined with acupuncture therapy can effectively alleviate symptoms of pediatric pneumonia, further enhancing clinical efficacy. Research indicates that comprehensive pattern differentiation and treatment is the key to improving the aforementioned complex conditions.
