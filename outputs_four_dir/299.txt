Translation
Headless boils commonly occur in patients with insensitivity of the skin, and the small intestine meridian of hand-Taiyang plays a crucial role in such syndromes. Thinking prevails over fear is beneficial for alleviating the condition, but it is necessary to distinguish from advanced syphilis. For infantile convulsions, we should start from the Taiyang wind attack pattern and combine it with the floating pulse for comprehensive diagnosis to achieve precise treatment.
