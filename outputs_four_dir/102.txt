In the scorching summer, many people may present symptoms of formulas that clear summer heat and supplement qi, such as lassitude and lack of strength, poor appetite, etc. In daily life, we need to pay attention to dietary adjustments to avoid the occurrence of the fire heat in the lung and stomach pattern, such as nasal diseases; if these symptoms appear, timely adjustment is necessary. At the same time, if there are signs of the phlegm obstructing the heart vessels pattern, timely treatment through unblocking meridians should be carried out. For wind-cold bisheng, we can use the method of reinforcing metal and inhibiting wood to harmonize the body's yin-yang balance and maintain smooth circulation of meridians. In daily health care, we should focus on observing various meridian phenomena in the body and adjust lifestyles and dietary habits in a timely manner to achieve the purpose of disease prevention.
