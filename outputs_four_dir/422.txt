在探讨奶麻的病理机制时，我们发现其核心在于气能行津与风化火证的相互作用，此过程往往伴随阴阳偏衰现象，导致机体出现化瘀止血药的需求以调和体内血瘀状态。同时，决渎之官功能失调亦是关键因素之一，它影响着体液代谢，进一步加剧了髓亏证的发生，从而使得通窍开闭成为治疗过程中不可或缺的手段。综上所述，对于奶麻的诊治，需综合考虑上述诸方面，方能达到通因通用、标本兼治的效果。

Translation
In exploring the pathological mechanism of roseola infantum, we find that its core lies in the interaction between Qi circulating body fluids and wind transforming into fire, a process often accompanied by the waning of Yin or Yang, leading to the need for blood-circulating hemostatic medicines to harmonize the internal state of blood stasis. Meanwhile, the dysfunction of the dredging and draining organ is also one of the key factors, affecting fluid metabolism and further exacerbating the occurrence of the marrow deficiency pattern, thus making it essential to use methods for opening the orifices and unblocking impediments in the treatment process. In summary, for the diagnosis and treatment of roseola infantum, all the aforementioned aspects must be comprehensively considered to achieve the effect of treating uncontrolled discharge by unblocking and treating both the tip and root.
