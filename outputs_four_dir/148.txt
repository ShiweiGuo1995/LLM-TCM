最近发现身上长了些小红点，疑似热气疮，打算试试食疗调理，多吃些清热解毒的食物。同时感觉精神状态不佳，可能是心肾阴虚证的表现，准备找时间去针灸科做下穴位埋线，加强调理。身边的朋友也有类似脾阳不足证的情况，建议他也要重视起来，调整饮食习惯，多吃温补食物。感觉自己可能还有气虚阻证，需要多休息，避免过度劳累。希望这些方法能帮助大家改善体质，保持健康。

Translation
Recently found some small red spots on my body, suspected to be heat sores, planning to try dietary therapy for adjustment, eating more foods that clear heat and remove toxins. At the same time feeling poor mental state, might be a manifestation of heart and kidney yin deficiency pattern, preparing to find time to go to the acupuncture department for catgut-embedding therapy to enhance the adjustment. Friends around me also have similar spleen yang insufficiency pattern, suggested him to pay attention and adjust dietary habits, eat more warming and tonifying foods. Feeling that I might also have qi deficiency pattern, need to rest more, avoid overwork. Hope these methods can help everyone improve their physique and maintain health.
