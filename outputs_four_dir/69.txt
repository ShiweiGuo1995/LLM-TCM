在探讨温邪导致的脱汗与黄汗现象时，我们注意到其临床表现不仅涉及皮肤腠理疏松，亦可伴随心痛彻背的症状，此乃邪气深入心肺所致。对于伤风鼻塞及脾系证类患者，采用利尿开窍之法，旨在疏通经络，恢复气血平衡。观察到部分病例中，身肢放长可能是邪气内陷的表现，需谨慎处理，以防病情迁延不愈。综合分析上述症状，治疗过程中需注重调和阴阳，以达到固本培元之效。

Translation
When discussing the phenomenon of exhausted sweating and yellow sweating caused by pathogenic warmth, we notice that its clinical manifestations not only involve loose interstices but can also be accompanied by chest pain radiating to the back, which is due to the pathogenic qi penetrating deeply into the heart and lungs. For patients with acute rhinitis and patterns of the spleen system, the method of promoting urination and opening the orifices is used, aiming to unblock the meridians and restore the balance of qi and blood. In some cases, lengthening the torso and limbs may be a sign of pathogenic qi internalizing, requiring careful handling to prevent the condition from becoming protracted. A comprehensive analysis of the above symptoms indicates that during treatment, it is essential to harmonize yin and yang to achieve the effect of consolidating the root and nourishing the origin.
