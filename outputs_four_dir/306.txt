Translation
When exploring the relationship between flaccid tongue and insomnia, we noticed that the phenomenon of rejected yang and blocked yin may affect multiple links in the six meridians patterns, leading to symptoms such as broken metal failing to sound. At the same time, in clinical observations, undescended testis and pumping wrist are also common symptoms, which are often closely related to bone lesions, indicating that during the treatment process, we need to comprehensively consider the patient's overall condition. By deeply studying these complex and subtle symptom manifestations, we can more accurately grasp the nature of the disease and provide more precise guidance for clinical treatment.
