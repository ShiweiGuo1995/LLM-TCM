最近有位朋友来找我咨询，说是身上长了上石疽，而且感觉身体不适，既有表里的症状，又伴有手少阳三焦经的不适感。在给他诊断时，我发现他的面色有些暗沉，这可能是望色的结果，结合他胃部的不适，初步判断为胃寒气逆证。为了更好地了解他的状况，我还进行了脉色合参，发现他的脉象也不太正常。治疗方面，我想采用清暑宣肺的方法来缓解他的症状，同时调理他的体质，希望他能早日康复。在日常生活中，我们要注意饮食，避免寒凉食物，燥和中是关键。

Translation
Recently, a friend came to consult me, saying that he had developed stony gangrene and felt unwell, with symptoms of both exterior and interior, accompanied by discomfort in the Sanjiao meridian of hand-Shaoyang. During his diagnosis, I found his complexion somewhat dark, which might be the result of colour diagnosis, combined with his discomfort in the stomach, initially diagnosing it as a Cold-induced ascending of stomach qi pattern. To better understand his condition, I also performed an overall analysis on the pulse and colour, finding his pulse conditions were also abnormal. In terms of treatment, I plan to use the method of Clear summer heat and disperse the lung to alleviate his symptoms while regulating his constitution, hoping for his early recovery. In daily life, we should pay attention to diet, avoiding cold and cool foods; regulating the middle and eliminating dryness is key.
