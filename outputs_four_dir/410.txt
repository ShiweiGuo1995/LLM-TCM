Translation
In TCM theory, regulating qi and blood is key for treating various diseases such as advanced schistosomiasis and anal abscess. For diseases caused by qi gate obstruction like suppurative osteomyelitis, the method of warming yang to dissipate yin cold is often used to regulate and balance yin and yang. Additionally, a knotted pulse as a pulse condition frequently indicates the presence of enterobiasis in the body. In clinical practice, different treatment methods are employed based on the condition to achieve optimal therapeutic effects.
