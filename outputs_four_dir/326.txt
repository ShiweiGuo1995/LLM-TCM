Original Text
在探讨妊娠期间的复杂病症时，我们注意到“妊娠腹痛”与“子肿”的临床表现及其潜在机制。对于妊娠期出现“饥不欲食”的症状，我们需谨慎处理，以避免不当治疗对母体及胎儿造成不良影响。同时，“妊娠用药禁忌”是必须严格遵守的原则，尤其是在采用“涌吐开关”等疗法时。值得注意的是，文献中偶见提及“花痴”一症，此症虽非妊娠特有，但在妊娠期间尤需重视。此外，针对某些特定情况，如“虚阳浮越证”，可能需要采取“短刺”等特殊治疗方法来调节体内阴阳平衡，从而达到治疗目的。综上所述，在处理妊娠期疾病时，需全面考虑上述各种因素，以确保母婴安全。

Translation
In discussing complex diseases during pregnancy, we have noted the clinical manifestations and underlying mechanisms of "abdominal pain in pregnancy" and "oedema during pregnancy". For symptoms of "hungry but with no appetite" appearing during pregnancy, we must handle them with caution to avoid adverse effects on the mother and fetus due to improper treatment. At the same time, "contraindicated medicines during pregnancy" is a principle that must be strictly adhered to, especially when employing therapies such as "induce vomiting to refresh the mind". It is noteworthy that literature occasionally mentions "sexual obsessions", a condition not unique to pregnancy but requiring particular attention during this period. Additionally, for certain specific conditions, such as the "floating of deficiency yang pattern", special therapeutic methods like "short needling" may be required to regulate the body's yin-yang balance, thereby achieving the therapeutic goal. In summary, when dealing with diseases during pregnancy, all of these factors should be comprehensively considered to ensure the safety of both mother and child.
