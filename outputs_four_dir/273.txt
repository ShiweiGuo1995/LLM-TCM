Original Text
最近有位朋友跟我分享了他的困扰，说是手臂上起了几个小疙瘩，痒得厉害，他说可能是漆毒作祟，我建议他先避免接触可能引起过敏的物质，并且可以试试用些清热解毒的草药。另外他还说有时候会感觉腹部不适，特别是饭后，我猜可能是中焦热盛证，提醒他饮食要清淡一些，多吃蔬菜水果，少吃油腻辛辣的食物。他还提到自己平时喜欢打太极拳，说是练拳时感觉身心舒畅，尤其是那个拳势，动作柔和缓慢，有助于调理肝主疏泄的功能，促进气血畅通。不过他也提到了自己的情绪有时会比较烦躁，我猜测可能是相火妄动，建议他可以通过冥想、静坐等方式来平复心情。最后，他提到颈部有个小肿块，不痛不痒，但担心是瘰疬或子岩，我建议他及时就医，通过专业手段确诊并治疗。希望我的一些建议对他有所帮助。

Translation
Recently, a friend shared with me his concerns, saying that he had developed several small papules on his arm which were extremely itchy. He mentioned that it might be lacquer dermatitis causing this, so I advised him to avoid contact with substances that could cause allergies and suggested he try using some folk medicines for clearing heat and removing toxins. Additionally, he mentioned that sometimes he felt discomfort in his abdomen, especially after meals. I guessed it might be due to middle jiao heat exuberance syndrome and reminded him to eat more lightly, consume more vegetables and fruits, and reduce the intake of greasy and spicy foods. He also mentioned that he enjoys practicing Taijiquan, saying that when he practices, he feels mentally and physically comfortable, particularly because the Taijiquan structure involves gentle and slow movements, which can help regulate the function of the liver governing the free flow of qi, promoting the smooth flow of qi and blood. However, he also mentioned that his emotions can sometimes become restless, and I speculated it might be due to the reckless stirring of ministerial fire, suggesting that he could calm his mind through meditation and sitting quietly. Finally, he mentioned that there was a small swelling in his neck, painless and itchy, but he was worried it might be scrofula or testicular cancer. I advised him to seek medical attention promptly to obtain professional diagnosis and treatment. I hope my suggestions will be helpful to him.
