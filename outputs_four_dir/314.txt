Translation
In the scorching summer when summer heat syncope occurs, we should pay attention to regulating the body to avoid Yin waxing with Yang waning. In daily life, by reinforcing the kidney and securing the fetus, we can strengthen the constitution. At the same time, we should also eliminate phlegm, regulate Qi and remove toxins in diet to maintain the balance of Yin and Yang within the body and prevent the waxing and waning of anti-pathogenic Qi and pathogenic factors. If discomfort occurs, timely regulation is necessary, such as using methods to transform stasis and stop bleeding to alleviate symptoms, while also clearing heat and reducing fire to restore health to the body. Remember, there are twelve earthly branches, each season has its own characteristics; we must follow the laws of nature to maintain good health.
