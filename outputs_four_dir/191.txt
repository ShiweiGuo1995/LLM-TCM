Translation
This article aims to explore the clinical efficacy of treating early morning diarrhea using the method of clearing heart fire and draining dampness. Through the analysis of the formula composition guided by the theory of ascending, descending, floating, and sinking, it is found that the rational configuration of principal, minister, assistant, and messenger herbs is crucial. This study selects raw Chinese medicines with neutral-property effects as minister herbs, supplemented by drugs for releasing the exterior and unblocking meridians, aiming to adjust the body's yin-yang balance and improve patient symptoms. The experimental results show that this method has significant effects on alleviating early morning diarrhea and accompanying sleep sex, further verifying the unique advantages of traditional Chinese medicine in treating complex diseases.
