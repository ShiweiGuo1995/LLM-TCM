在本次研究中，我们观察到趺阳脉异常与气郁化热证密切相关，患者常表现为瞪目直视症状，提示气机不畅导致的火热内生。进一步探讨发现，此类患者的临床表现亦可见脾肾阳虚证，治疗时需兼顾化痰通窍，以达到清胃泄火之效。此外，对于某些复杂病例，如伴有杨梅结毒的小儿顿嗽，治疗策略应更加个体化，注重调整机体阴阳平衡，以期获得最佳疗效。

Translation
In this study, we observed that abnormalities in the Fuyang pulse are closely related to the Qi stagnation transformed fire pattern, with patients often presenting symptoms of blank staring, indicating the endogenous generation of fire due to obstructed Qi movement. Further exploration revealed that clinical manifestations in such patients also include the Yang deficiency of the spleen and kidney pattern, and treatment should take into account resolving phlegm and unblocking orifices to achieve the effect of clearing and reducing stomach heat. Additionally, for certain complex cases, such as children with whooping cough accompanied by advanced syphilis, treatment strategies should be more individualized, focusing on adjusting the balance between Yin and Yang of the body to achieve the best therapeutic effect.
