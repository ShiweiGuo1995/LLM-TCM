Translation
In TCM, the pattern of blood deficiency-induced wind dryness is often caused by insufficient yin and blood within the body and invasion of pathogenic wind, commonly manifesting symptoms such as dryness of the cornea and iris. In treatment, we use formulas that reinforce healthy qi and release the exterior to regulate and harmonize qi and blood, supplemented by soothing the liver and extinguishing wind methods to help patients recover health. For dental abscesses caused by cold enveloping fire, using Yi Zhi Chan pushing with the flexed thumb combined with lifting and securing qi methods can effectively alleviate symptoms and promote recovery from the disease. During the treatment process, it is necessary to pay attention to dietary adjustments, avoiding stimulating foods to prevent aggravation of the condition.
