在探讨中医治疗原则时，我们常提到“相须”这一概念，即两种功效相似或互补的药物配合使用以增强疗效。例如，在处理“心肺阴虚证”时，采用“滋阴清热”的方法可以有效改善症状。而对于“泄泻病”，中医主张“温下实寒”，通过温补来调整体内阴阳平衡。值得注意的是，“脾积气”是导致消化不良的重要因素之一，治疗时需注重调理脾胃。此外，“先天之本”指的是肾，肾功能的好坏直接影响人体健康，因此在治疗过程中也需加以重视。“清胃降火”和“温下实寒”则是在不同体质下常用的治疗方法，前者适用于胃火旺盛的情况，后者则针对体内寒湿过重的问题。综上所述，中医治疗不仅需要辨证施治，还要结合患者的具体情况，灵活运用各种治疗方法。

Translation
When discussing the principles of TCM treatment, we often mention the concept of "mutual reinforcement," where two drugs with similar or complementary effects are used together to enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, when dealing with the "heart and lung yin deficiency pattern," the method of "nourishing yin and clearing heat" can effectively improve symptoms. As for "diarrhea," TCM advocates "warm yang and dissipate cold," adjusting the body's yin-yang balance through warming and tonifying methods. It is noteworthy that "masses in the spleen" are one of the important factors leading to digestive disorders; during treatment, it is necessary to focus on regulating the spleen and stomach. Additionally, "innate foundation" refers to the kidney, and the quality of kidney function directly affects human health, so it must also be given due attention in the treatment process. "Clearing and reducing stomach heat" and "warm yang and dissipate cold" are commonly used treatment methods under different constitutions; the former is suitable for cases of excessive stomach fire, while the latter targets issues of excessive internal cold-dampness. In summary, TCM treatment not only requires pattern differentiation but also needs to combine the patient's specific conditions, flexibly applying various treatment methods.
