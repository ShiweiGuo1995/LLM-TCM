Translation
In TCM, "cold enveloping fire" is considered one of the causes of various diseases; it can be effectively diagnosed through abdominal palpation and tapping manipulation. Treatment should adopt routine treatment to adjust the Qi transformation of the urinary bladder and alleviate the burning sensation of the anus. Meanwhile, a yellowish complexion may indicate spleen deficiency and requires regulation through Gongfa such as Taiji fan to promote the balance of Yin and Yang within the body.
