Translation
Obstetric (rectovaginal) fistula and skin itch affect many people, often accompanied by ulcerative gingivitis. In treatment, we commonly use formulas that reinforce healthy qi and release the exterior to remove wind and promote skin eruption, while using drugs with actions to dissipate cold and open the orifices to alleviate symptoms. In some cases, the pattern of Qi stagnation of the liver and stomach may also occur, requiring combined needling manipulation at the Gaohuang point to regulate and harmonize qi and blood, achieving the effect of dissipating cold and opening the orifices. Through comprehensive treatment, these complex conditions can be effectively improved.
