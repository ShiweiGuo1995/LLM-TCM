最近有位家长问我关于孩子囟陷的问题，这让我想到了中医里的“提弹法”，在治疗上可以试试看。同时观察到孩子有些肺恶寒的症状，可能与体内膀胱积热证有关，需要及时调理。记得在日常生活中，我们也要关注孩子的饮食，避免食用过于油腻的食物，以免加重膀胱积热的情况。另外，现在正是季节交替的时候，也是小儿血吸虫病高发期，家长们一定要注意预防。说到调理，我们不能忽视胆气的重要性，它与情绪、睡眠等都有密切关系。中医常说“血汗同源”，所以在调理时也需要注意气血的平衡。最后，还要提醒大家注意六气的变化，顺应自然规律，才能保持健康。

Translation
Recently, a parent asked me about their child's sunken fontanels, which reminded me of the "lifting-flicking manipulation" in Traditional Chinese Medicine; it might be worth trying in treatment. At the same time, I observed symptoms of lung aversion to cold in the child, which could be related to the heat accumulating in the urinary bladder pattern, and timely regulation is needed. Remember, in daily life, we should also pay attention to the child's diet, avoiding overly greasy foods to prevent exacerbating the bladder heat accumulation condition. Additionally, it is currently the transitional period between seasons, which is also a high incidence period for pediatric schistosomiasis; parents must pay attention to prevention. Speaking of regulation, we cannot overlook the importance of gallbladder qi, which is closely related to emotions and sleep. In TCM, it is often said that "blood and sweat share the same source," so during regulation, the balance of qi and blood should also be considered. Finally, everyone should also pay attention to the changes in the six qi, adapting to the natural laws to maintain health.
