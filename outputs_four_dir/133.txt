本研究旨在探讨邪热伤阴证与肺热炽盛证在食瘕患者中的临床表现及治疗策略。通过分析病例，我们发现此类患者常伴有肝阳上亢证，其主要症状表现为胸闷烦躁、口干舌燥等。针对上述证候，治疗时应注重行气散结以改善症状，同时辅以泻火攻下之法清除体内积热。此外，对于伴随出血症状者，推荐使用固崩止带剂以达到止血效果；而对于便秘患者，则需应用润下剂以促进肠道蠕动，从而实现整体疗效的提升。

This study aims to explore the clinical manifestations and treatment strategies of the pathogenic heat damaging yin pattern and the exuberance of lung heat pattern in patients with stomach masses due to food retention. Through case analysis, we found that such patients often present with the liver yang ascendant hyperactivity pattern, with main symptoms including chest stuffiness, restlessness, dry mouth, etc. For the above syndromes, during treatment, it is important to regulate qi and resolve masses to improve symptoms, while also using fire-clearing purgation methods to eliminate internal accumulated heat. Additionally, for those with accompanying bleeding symptoms, it is recommended to use formulas that stop bleeding/leucorrhoea to achieve hemostasis; for constipation patients, lubricating purgative formulas should be applied to promote intestinal peristalsis, thereby enhancing overall therapeutic effects.
