Translation
In exploring brain system disorders, we find that anger causing the Qi to rise is a common trigger, which not only exacerbates the condition but may also lead to severe symptoms such as haemoptysis. For such conditions, the use of repeated shallow needling combined with methods to open the chest and soothe the diaphragm is particularly crucial, especially for patients with Yang pattern, as this approach can effectively alleviate symptoms. Meanwhile, excessive overthinking can easily damage the Spleen Qi, leading to the Worry damaging the spleen pattern; in such cases, the method of nourishing Yin and moistening dryness can assist in improving physical constitution and promoting recovery. In summary, by comprehensively applying these methods when treating brain system disorders, one can better regulate the patient's bodily functions and achieve the therapeutic goal.
