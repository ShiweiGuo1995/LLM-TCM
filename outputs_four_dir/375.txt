最近有位朋友因为工作压力大，心情烦躁，晚上总是难以入睡，白天又觉得疲倦，我推荐她试试解郁安神的方法，比如泡点具有滋补心阴作用的草药茶。另外，她的背部有些僵硬，我建议她可以试试扩背的动作来缓解，同时也能增强体质。她还提到偶尔会有喉咙不适的情况，我担心可能是喉痈的前兆，提醒她要注意休息和饮食。另外，她最近刚生完宝宝，身体还在恢复期，特别需要注意产后败血冲心的问题，要多吃一些峻下逐水药，帮助排除体内湿气。家里老人也有点小毛病，关节疼痛，诊断为痹证，需要适当增加一些润燥化痰剂来调理。希望这些建议对她有所帮助。

Translation
Recently, a friend of mine has been under great work pressure, feeling restless and agitated, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night, and feeling fatigued during the day. I recommended that she try the method of relieving stagnation and calming the mind, such as brewing some herbal tea with herbs that have the effect of nourishing and supplementing heart yin. Additionally, her back was somewhat stiff, so I suggested she could try expanding her back to alleviate this, which can also enhance her physical constitution. She also mentioned occasional discomfort in her throat, and I worried it might be a precursor to peritonsillar abscess, advising her to pay attention to rest and diet. Furthermore, she recently gave birth and is still in the recovery period; she needs to be particularly cautious about the issue of lochia disturbing the heart mind, and should eat more drastic water-expelling medicines to help expel dampness from her body. There are also minor ailments with the elderly in her family, experiencing joint pain diagnosed as Bi-impediment disorders, requiring an appropriate increase in formulas that moisten dryness and transform phlegm for adjustment. I hope these suggestions will be helpful to her.
