最近春意盎然，正是春夏养阳的好时节。大家在日常生活中不妨多晒晒太阳，增强体质。我最近在门诊时遇到一位患者，他面色苍白，畏寒怕冷，这显然是实寒证的表现。经过一番辨证施治，我决定采用扶正补气的方法，并辅以悬灸来温通经络。此外，我还建议他多吃一些温热性质的食物，如姜和葱，避免生冷食物。另一位患者则出现了热入气分证的症状，表现为发热口渴，我给他开了些清热解毒的方子，并配合豁痰燥的治疗方法。中医讲究因人而异，同一种病症在不同人体内表现可能大不相同，因此治疗也要灵活变通。记得保持良好的生活习惯，适当运动，才能更好地调养身体，预防疾病。

Translation
Recently, with the arrival of spring, it is a good time to protect Yang in spring and summer. In daily life, everyone should try to get more sun exposure to enhance physical fitness. Recently, when I was seeing patients in the clinic, I encountered one whose facial complexion was pale and who had cold intolerance, which are obvious manifestations of an excess cold pattern. After careful pattern differentiation, I decided to use the method of tonifying qi and supplementing anti-pathogenic qi, supplemented by suspended moxibustion to warm and unblock the meridians and collaterals. Additionally, I recommended that he eat more warming foods such as ginger and green onions and avoid cold and raw foods. Another patient presented symptoms of heat entering the qi phase pattern, characterized by fever and thirst; I prescribed a formula to clear heat and remove toxins and combined it with a treatment to resolve phlegm and dry dampness. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes individual differences, and the same disease may present very differently in different people, so treatment must be flexible and adaptable. Remember to maintain good living habits and engage in appropriate exercise to better nourish the body and prevent diseases.
