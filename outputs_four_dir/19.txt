Original Text
最近有位朋友跟我抱怨，他总是感觉听力下降，出现了重听的情况，而且手脚无力，肢体痿废。我了解后发现他的生活习惯并不好，经常熬夜，饮食也不规律，导致了脏腑功能失调。建议他平时可以多吃一些活血祛瘀剂的食物，比如山楂、桃仁等，帮助身体清除瘀血，促进血液循环。同时，他还应该注意辟秽通窍，保持室内空气流通，避免吸入有害气体。如果情况严重，一定要及时就医，通过清泄脏腑来调整身体状态，防止阴损及阳，影响到命门的功能。对于肠道问题，要注意清理阻肠道证，避免便秘对健康造成更大的威胁。希望朋友们都能注重日常保健，远离疾病困扰。

Translation
Recently, a friend complained to me that he always felt his hearing declining and experiencing hearing impairment, and his hands and feet were weak with limb flaccidity and disuse. After understanding his condition, I found that his lifestyle was not good; he often stayed up late and had irregular eating habits, leading to dysfunction of the Zang-fu organs. I suggested that he should eat more foods that can circulate blood and eliminate stasis, such as hawthorn and peach kernel, which help the body remove stagnant blood and promote blood circulation. At the same time, he should also pay attention to repel foulness and open the orifices, ensuring indoor air circulation and avoiding inhaling harmful gases. If the situation is severe, he must seek medical treatment in time to clear and reduce interior heat and adjust his body state, preventing impairment of Yin affecting Yang from impacting the function of The Gate of Life. For intestinal issues, it is necessary to avoid constipation and clear obstructions in the intestines to prevent greater threats to health. I hope friends can pay attention to daily health care and stay away from disease troubles.
