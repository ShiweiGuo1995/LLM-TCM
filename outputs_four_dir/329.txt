Original Text
最近在跟一位朋友聊天时发现他总是感到胸闷气短，怀疑是气滞痰阻证，提醒他平时要注意饮食，少吃油腻食物，多吃一些清肺润燥的食物。另外他还经常感觉小便黄赤，可能是膀胱积热证，建议他多喝水，适当运动。我告诉他要保持心情舒畅，避免情绪波动，因为这可能会加重病情。此外，他的舌苔有些厚腻，呈现霉酱苔的状态，这也可能是体内湿气过重的表现。如果情况没有改善，最好去医院检查一下，看看是否还有心水病。在日常生活中，我们可以用长针进行简单的自我按摩，帮助分消走泄体内的湿气，同时也要注意作息规律，保证充足的睡眠，让身体阴阳平衡，尤其是要让阳中之阴得到充分休息。

Translation
Recently, while chatting with a friend, I found that he often feels chest stuffiness and shortness of breath, suspecting it to be Qi stagnation with phlegm retention pattern, and advised him to pay attention to his diet, eating less greasy food and more food that can clear lung heat and moisten dryness. Additionally, he frequently experiences yellow, reddish urine, which might indicate heat accumulating in the urinary bladder pattern; I suggested that he drink more water and engage in appropriate physical exercise. I told him to maintain a pleasant mood and avoid emotional fluctuations, as this could worsen his condition. Furthermore, his tongue coating is somewhat thick and greasy, showing a state of rotten-curdy coating, which may also be a sign of excessive dampness inside the body. If there's no improvement, it would be best for him to go to the hospital for a check-up to see if he has congestive heart failure. In daily life, we can use long needles for simple self-massage to help induce urination and promote bowel movements to eliminate dampness from the body, while also paying attention to regular作息 and ensuring adequate sleep, maintaining the balance of Yin and Yang in the body, especially allowing Yin within Yang to rest sufficiently.
