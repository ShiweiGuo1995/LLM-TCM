Translation
In discussing the treatment strategies for high fever (Zhuang) and mother-of-malaria (疟母), we emphasize the importance of "preventing a disease before it arises (治未病)", advocating a method that combines nourishing Yin and calming the mind (养阴安神) with removing toxins and circulating Qi (解毒开闭) to achieve a combination of prevention and treatment. For patients with hysteria (脏躁), attention should be paid to regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach (调和脾胃), clearing the heat pattern of the spleen (胃热证), while also considering the impact of epidemic cholera (时疫霍乱), in order to achieve an overall adjustment effect.
