Translation
In treating the blood heat syndrome, we need to pay attention to the condition of fire consuming qi and body fluids, and select treatment methods based on the patient's specific circumstances and local conditions. For abscess disorders, methods such as contralateral blood-letting or distal needling can be used to achieve the effect of drawing out pus and toxin. At the same time, in sore-/ulcer-resolving methods, harmonizing Ying-nutrient blood is also an important approach, promoting the recovery of sores and ulcers by regulating Ying-nutrient blood.
