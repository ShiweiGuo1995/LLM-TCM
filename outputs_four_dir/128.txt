Translation
Recently, due to the dry weather, many friends have developed a need for nourishing blood and moistening dryness. By using the method of sour and sweet transforming into yin, we can effectively improve our physical condition. Some people may experience symptoms of intestinal tuberculosis, which not only affects digestive function but also leads to skin issues such as squamous cell carcinoma. We can alleviate these symptoms by opening the chest and soothing the diaphragm. At the same time, for those with a constitution that tends to be cold, appropriate tonification of yang is necessary, but it must be done properly. In daily life, we can also enhance our physique and improve resistance by inducing sweating and warming the interior. Of course, when making these adjustments, we should also pay attention to whether the six yin pulses are balanced to maintain overall health.
