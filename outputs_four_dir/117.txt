在中医理论中，拿揉法常用于调理脾胃功能，对于脾气亏虚证有着显著疗效。过逸则容易导致气血运行不畅，进而引发各种疾病。闻诊类是诊断疾病的重要手段之一，通过听患者的声音变化可以初步判断病情。在《黄帝内经》中提到的十二正经证类，更是全面涵盖了人体生理病理的各种表现。例如戴眼反折这一症状，常常提示病势危重；而点刺舌则是观察舌象变化的一种方法，对于诊断某些疾病具有重要参考价值。睑弦赤烂则多见于肝胆湿热或风热上扰之症，需结合其他症状综合分析。

Translation
In TCM theory, the grasping-kneading manipulation is often used to regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach, showing significant efficacy for the spleen qi deficiency pattern. Physical inactivity can easily lead to stagnation of qi and blood, thereby triggering various diseases. Auscultation and olfaction is one of the important methods for diagnosing diseases; by listening to changes in the patient's voice, the condition can be preliminarily judged. The patterns of the twelve regular meridians mentioned in the Huangdi Neijing comprehensively cover various physiological and pathological manifestations of the human body. For example, the symptom of eyes fixed upward often indicates a critical condition; while spotted tongue is a method for observing changes in tongue manifestations, which has important reference value for diagnosing certain diseases. Red, wet and ulcerative eyelid is mostly seen in cases of liver and gallbladder damp-heat or wind-heat disturbing upward, and needs to be analyzed in combination with other symptoms.
