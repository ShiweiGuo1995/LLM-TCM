在探讨疫疔与溏结不调的病理机制时，我们发现疫疔不仅与湿邪有关，还常伴随中气不足而生。对于此类病症，采用拨法配合开吸合呼之呼吸调节法，可有效改善患者症状。然而，临床观察中亦可见到胃燥津亏证患者，其主要表现为爪为筋之余之异常，此症多因长期性疾病消耗所致，治疗上需重视调理脾胃，补充津液，避免🗎性黏滞之品，以防病情迁延。针对上述情况，提出综合施治方案，以期达到标本兼治之效。

Translation
In exploring the pathological mechanisms of epidemic carbuncle and irregular bowel movements, we find that it is not only related to dampness but often accompanied by deficiency of central qi. For such conditions, using plucking manipulation combined with opening with breathing in and closing with breathing out can effectively alleviate patient symptoms. However, clinical observations also reveal cases of the pattern of stomach dryness due to loss of fluids, primarily manifesting as abnormalities in nails being the extension of sinews, which is mostly caused by long-term disease consumption. In treatment, it is essential to focus on regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach, replenishing thin body fluids, and avoiding dampness that is sticky and stagnant to prevent the condition from becoming protracted. For the aforementioned situations, a comprehensive treatment plan is proposed to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and root.
