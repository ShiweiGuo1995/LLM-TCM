在探讨风温病时，我们常遇到热邪阻痹证与痰火扰神证，二者皆因外感风温，内生湿热，导致肺气不宣，痰浊内生，进而出现咳嗽、胸闷等症状。对于润化燥痰之法，在治疗此类病症时尤为重要。而石淋一症，则多由湿热下注，蕴结成石，阻滞尿路，表现为小便涩痛，尿中带血。此外，暑困脾证亦是夏季常见，因暑湿困阻脾胃，运化失司，可见食欲不振、腹胀等症。至于皮肤病如金钱癣，虽非直接关联上述内伤病症，但在中医理论中，内外相因，调理全身才是根本。通过辨证施治，调和阴阳，方能达到治病求本的目的。

Translation
In discussing wind fever, we often encounter the pattern of pathogenic heat affecting the bones/joints and the pattern of phlegm fire disturbing the heart, both of which arise from external contraction of wind pestilence with lung heat, internal generation of dampness and heat, leading to failure of Lung qi to be宣 (moistened), and internal production of phlegm turbidity, thus manifesting symptoms such as cough and chest闷 (moistening). For the method of moistening dryness and transforming phlegm, it is particularly important in treating such conditions. As for the disorder of stone strangury, it is mostly due to downward infiltration of dampness and heat, coagulation into stones, obstructing the urinary tract, characterized by difficult, painful urination and hematuria. Additionally, the pattern of summer-heat困 (impeding) the spleen is also common in summer, due to summer-dampness impeding and obstructing the spleen and stomach, failure of transportation and transformation, presenting symptoms like loss of appetite and abdominal胀 (distension). Regarding skin diseases such as tinea corporis, although not directly associated with the aforementioned internal injury patterns, according to the theory of TCM, internal and external factors are interrelated, and regulating the whole body is fundamental. Through辨证施治 (pattern identification and treatment), harmonizing Yin and Yang, can we achieve the purpose of treating the root cause of the disease.
