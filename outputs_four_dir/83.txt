在本次研究中，我们探讨了心脾两虚证与偏痹之间的关系，发现心脾两虚证患者常伴有小便黄赤、多梦等症状，舌象表现为舌质淡、苔薄白，脉象则多见涩脉。此外，针对胃寒饮停证患者，我们亦观察到类似的小便黄赤现象，提示该症状可能与多种证候相关。治疗上，对于心脾两虚证合并偏痹者，采用清心泻肺法以调和气血，缓解偏痹症状；而对于胃寒饮停证，则需温阳化饮，佐以活血通络之品，避免病情进一步发展为胎疮等严重后果。

Translation
In this study, we explored the relationship between the pattern of deficiency of the heart and spleen and hemiparalysis, finding that patients with this pattern often present symptoms such as yellow, reddish urine and excessive dreaming. The tongue manifestation is characterized by a pale tongue body and thin white coating, while the pulse condition predominantly shows hesitant pulse. Additionally, for patients with the pattern of cold fluids retention in the stomach, we also observed similar symptoms of yellow, reddish urine, indicating that this symptom may be related to various patterns. In treatment, for those with hemiparalysis combined with the pattern of deficiency of the heart and spleen, the method of clearing heat in the heart and lung is used to regulate and harmonize qi and blood, alleviating the symptoms of hemiparalysis; whereas for the pattern of cold fluids retention in the stomach, it is necessary to warm and transform cold fluid retention, supplemented with products that harmonize meridians and unblock channels to avoid further development of severe consequences such as pediatric eczema.
