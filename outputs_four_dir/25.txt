春季来临，万物复苏，但也是风温肆虐之时。大家在日常生活中要注意保暖，避免感受风邪，尤其要注意孩子的健康，避免胎毒蕴热证的发生。如果孩子出现发热、烦躁等症状，家长可以尝试用拂法按摩，帮助缓解症状。饮食上也要注意清淡，少吃油腻辛辣的食物。如果病情加重，一定要及时就医，切不可盲目使用攻下药或辛凉解表剂。另外，穿着方面，尖裆裤虽时尚，但在春季还是选择宽松舒适的衣物为宜，以免闷热不适。在家中也可以适当使用利水渗剂来保持空气清新湿润。

Translation
Spring arrives and all things come to life, but it is also the time when wind febrile disorders run rampant. In daily life, everyone should pay attention to keeping warm to avoid being affected by pathogenic wind, especially focusing on children's health to prevent the occurrence of the fetal toxin and heat accumulation pattern. If children show symptoms such as fever and restlessness, parents can try using brushing manipulation for massage to help alleviate these symptoms. Diet should also focus on lightness, consuming less greasy and spicy food. If the condition worsens, one must seek medical treatment in a timely manner and not use attacking purgative medicines or formulas that release the exterior with pungent cool medicines blindly. Additionally, regarding clothing, although sharp-angled crotch pants are fashionable, loose and comfortable clothes are more suitable in spring to avoid discomfort from stuffiness and heat. At home, one can appropriately use moisture-permeable agents to maintain fresh and humid air.
