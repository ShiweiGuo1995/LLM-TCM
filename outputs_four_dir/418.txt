Translation
In discussing perimenstrual disorders, we need to focus on the balance of Yin and Yang within the body. Phenomena such as vulvar swelling and excessive Yang repelling Yin often lead to a series of discomfort symptoms. Through palpation diagnosis and pattern differentiation, applying the principle of reinforcing healthy Qi to eliminate pathogenic factors to regulate the waxing and waning of Yin and Yang, the treatment goal can be achieved. In the face of sudden cardiac syncope, panic calming therapy should be quickly applied to prevent the condition from worsening. In this process, it is crucial to integrate the application of traditional Chinese medicine theory to guide clinical practice.
