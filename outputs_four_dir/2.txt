在中医治疗中，我们讲究分经论治，针对不同的病症采用不同的治疗方法。比如牛皮癣，这是一种常见的皮肤病，而侠瘿瘤则是一种颈部肿瘤。在治疗过程中，我们还需注意胞宫热证，避免病情加重。行针是中医常用的治疗方法之一，通过刺激穴位来调整身体机能。对于脾虚生风证和五志化火的情况，我们也需要采取相应的调理措施。当然，在日常生活中，我们也要注意饮食习惯，避免食用过于辛辣的食物，以免引发石蛾等不适症状。

Translation
In TCM treatment, we emphasize the principle of formulating prescriptions based on meridian differentiation, adopting different therapeutic methods for different diseases. For instance, collar sore is a common skin disease, while hyperparathyroidism is a type of neck tumor. During the treatment process, we also need to pay attention to heat patterns in the uterine region to avoid aggravating the condition. Needling manipulation is one of the commonly used TCM treatment methods, which adjusts bodily functions by stimulating acupoints. For spleen deficiency generating wind pattern and five emotions transforming into fire, we also need to take corresponding adjustment measures. Of course, in daily life, we should also pay attention to dietary habits and avoid eating excessively spicy foods to prevent symptoms such as stony tonsillitis.
