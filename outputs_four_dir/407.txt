Translation
In treating lung heat disease, we often adopt the method of processing with both water and fire to balance the body's yin and yang, while using herbs with the effect of tonifying qi and astringing tears to alleviate symptoms. For patients with the pattern of heart vessels stasis, in addition to regulating and harmonizing qi and blood, it is also necessary to focus on the regulation of the pattern of yang deficiency of the spleen and stomach, by warming and tonifying kidney qi to improve physical constitution. In this process, reasonable compatibility of drugs and the use of appropriate decoction form can help better achieve the effect of issue forces from the four extremities, thereby comprehensively adjusting bodily functions and promoting recovery.
