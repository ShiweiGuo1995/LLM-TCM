最近有位朋友向我诉苦，说自己总是感觉身体乏力，面色苍白，仔细观察发现她的唇四白有些发暗，询问后得知她经常感到腹部不适，尤其在天气转凉时更为明显，这可能是脾肾阳虚证的表现。我建议她可以试试通过滚法按摩来缓解症状，同时饮食上要注意避免过于寒凉的食物，多吃一些温补脾肾的食物。另外，她还提到自己有时候会出现地图舌的情况，这可能与体内风温肺热病有关，需要及时调理，以免病情加重。如果能够及时调整生活习惯，改善体征，相信她的状况会有所好转。

Translation
Recently, a friend complained to me that she always felt weak and had a pale facial complexion. Upon careful observation, I noticed that the four whites of her lips were somewhat darkened. After inquiring further, I learned that she often experienced abdominal discomfort, especially when the weather turned cooler, which might be a manifestation of a pattern of spleen-kidney yang deficiency. I suggested that she could try using the rolling manipulation with the proximal interphalangeal joints to alleviate her symptoms. Meanwhile, she should pay attention to avoid overly cold foods in her diet and eat more foods that can warm and tonify the spleen and kidney. Additionally, she mentioned that sometimes she would experience a geographical tongue, which might be related to a disease of wind-pestilence with lung heat, requiring timely adjustment to prevent the condition from worsening. If she could adjust her lifestyle in time and improve her signs, I believe her condition would improve.
