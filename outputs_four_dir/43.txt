When discussing the application of the Tremor method, we need to start from the perspective of the Combination of the four diagnostic methods, and analyze according to the specific symptoms of the patient. For cases where the condition is neither exterior nor interior caused by external etiological factors, adopting the strategy of inducing vomiting and promoting bowel movements can effectively alleviate the condition. At the same time, during the treatment process, if there is a situation of Deficiency complicated with Excess, using the method of combining Drying Phlegm agents with Blood-circulating Haemostatic medicines can better adjust the Yin-Yang balance within the body and achieve the therapeutic goal.
