在临床实践中，我们常遇到温邪侵袭肺卫证的患者，表现为发热咳嗽等症状。对于此类病症，调理脾胃至关重要，因为胃气亏虚证往往伴随出现。夏季高温易引发中暑，此时应注意补充水分和电解质。女性产后气血两虚，易发生产后血崩，故需及时调理。热毒蕴肤证常见于皮肤感染患者，治疗时需内外兼治。小儿赤游丹是儿童常见的急性传染病，防治上应注重提高免疫力。在治疗过程中，阴阳相错的状态需要特别关注，以达到调和阴阳的目的。

Translation
In clinical practice, we often encounter patients with the syndrome of warm pathogen attacking the lung defense, presenting symptoms such as fever and cough. For such diseases, it is crucial to regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach, as the pattern of stomach qi deficiency frequently accompanies it. High temperatures in summer can easily lead to summer heat stroke; at this time, attention should be paid to replenishing water and electrolytes. Postpartum women often experience dual deficiency of qi and blood, making them prone to postpartum bleeding; thus, timely regulation is necessary. The pattern of retained heat toxin in the skin is commonly seen in patients with skin infections; during treatment, both internal and external therapies are required. Paediatric erysipelas is a common acute contagious disease in children, and prevention and treatment should focus on enhancing immunity. During the treatment process, the state of Yin and yang mutually interact needs special attention to achieve the goal of harmonizing Yin and Yang.
