Translation
Guasha therapy is remarkably effective in treating the Qi counterflow pattern, effectively alleviating symptoms by stimulating the Ren meridian. For patients with Fasciolopsiasis, Warming-Opening agents are one of the commonly used treatment methods, capable of helping to eliminate internal dampness and improve symptoms of chills alone without fever. Meanwhile, dietary adjustments should focus on light foods, avoiding excessively spicy foods to prevent aggravation of the Qi counterflow condition. Bland-flavored foods help regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach, promoting digestion and preventing the occurrence of sudden spurt of appetite prior to collapse.
