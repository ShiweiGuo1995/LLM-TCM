Translation
A patient with white facial complexion often suffers from stomach ache, which is caused by invasion of cold-dampness into the spleen and stomach. During treatment, it is essential to regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach Qi to adjust the Qi of the spleen and stomach. Additionally, if pulling-shaking manipulation frequently occurs, it indicates the pattern of retained heat toxin in the skin, suggesting the need to apply fire processing to clear heat and remove toxins, while also regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach to prevent the pattern of heat affecting the bones/joints from further development. For the accumulation of damp toxin pattern, it is equally important to emphasize the use of fire processing to clear heat and remove toxins, promoting the circulation of Qi and Blood to alleviate symptoms.
