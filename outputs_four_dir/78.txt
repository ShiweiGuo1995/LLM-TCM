Translation
In this study, we explored the therapeutic effects of clearing and reducing stagnant heat on patients with pain below the heart, and adjusted the heat control in decoction to achieve optimal efficacy. The research indicates that the harmony between innate qi and healthy qi is one of the key factors in the treatment process, while the abundance or deficiency of Kidney qi also directly influences the development of the condition. Based on this foundation, we also introduced methods such as plain stir-frying and transforming blood stasis and soothing the heart, aiming to regulate the patient's Qi and Blood from multiple aspects, in order to achieve the goal of treating both the tip and root. The experimental results show that the comprehensive use of the aforementioned methods can effectively improve the patient's symptoms and enhance their quality of life.
