Translation
This article aims to explore the impact of the movement of the year on heart system diseases, particularly by analyzing the clinical manifestations of vexation during pregnancy and disharmony between the Chong and Ren pattern, combined with the application of blood-tonifying medicines and channel guide drugs, in order to achieve the purpose of preventing transmission of a disease after its onset. The study found that acupuncture therapies have significant effects in adjusting the disharmony between the Chong and Ren pattern, while also pointing out that the rational application of blood-tonifying medicines is crucial for improving symptoms of vexation during pregnancy. Further research indicates that the movement of the year not only affects human physiological functions but may also induce or exacerbate the aforementioned conditions; therefore, age movement factors should be fully considered in the treatment process, and acupuncture therapies and channel guide drugs should be flexibly applied to achieve optimal therapeutic effects.
