在探讨斑痧与药疹的鉴别诊断时，我们注意到两者虽均表现为皮肤异常，但斑痧多由外感时邪引起，而药疹则主要因药物反应所致。对于斑痧患者的治疗，需重视其舌象变化，尤其是假苔的观察，以判断病情进展及预后。此外，在脉诊方面，结脉常提示病程较长，病情较为复杂。针对此类病症，临床实践中应灵活运用和法，如散寒开闭、和络等方法，以达到调和阴阳、缓解症状的目的。特别值得注意的是，冬瘟作为一种季节性流行病，其防治策略亦应包括上述原则，尤其在冬季应加强预防措施，避免疾病传播。通过综合运用以上治法，可有效改善患者症状，提高临床疗效。

Translation
In discussing the differential diagnosis between dry cholera and drug-induced dermatitis, we note that although both conditions manifest as skin abnormalities, dry cholera is often caused by invasion of seasonal pathogenic factors, whereas drug-induced dermatitis is primarily due to drug reactions. For patients with dry cholera, it is crucial to pay attention to changes in tongue manifestations, especially the observation of false coating, to assess the progression of the disease and prognosis. Additionally, in pulse diagnosis, a knotted pulse often indicates a longer course of the disease and a more complex condition. In clinical practice, the harmonizing method should be flexibly applied, such as dispersing cold to open closure and unblocking meridians, aiming to achieve the purpose of harmonizing yin and yang and alleviating symptoms. It is particularly noteworthy that winter pestilence, as a seasonal epidemic, should also include the aforementioned principles in its prevention and treatment strategies, especially strengthening preventive measures in winter to prevent the spread of the disease. By comprehensively applying these therapeutic methods, patient symptoms can be effectively improved, enhancing clinical efficacy.
