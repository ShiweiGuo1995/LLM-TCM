This article aims to explore the similarities and differences in clinical manifestations and treatment strategies between furuncles and epidemic hemorrhagic fever. Studies have shown that the occurrence of furuncles is closely related to the dysfunction of the pairing between the spleen and stomach, while epidemic hemorrhagic fever often manifests as Taiyang-fu organ pattern or Taiyin pattern. During the treatment process, it is necessary to focus on nourishing liver yin to improve the internal environment. For patients with phlegm turbidity obstructing the middle jiao, corresponding measures should be taken to regulate the zang-fu organ functions and promote recovery from the disease. Medicines should be taken warm to enhance their efficacy. In summary, by comprehensively analyzing the above symptoms and patterns, this study provides a reference basis for clinical treatment.
