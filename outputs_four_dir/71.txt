最近在门诊遇到一位家长，他们的小儿温疫类病症状比较明显，孩子总是高热不退，食欲不振。我建议家长平时要注意孩子的饮食清淡，用药方面可以考虑一些轻灵的药物，并且要注意敛臀的动作，避免加重病情。同时，孩子还出现了胃火气逆证的症状，表现为口干舌燥，大便干燥，这也与饮食有关。另外，我注意到孩子的脚气也有些问题，可能是因为天气潮湿导致的，建议保持脚部干燥清洁。此外，孩子的目疾也很严重，风弦赤烂让他经常揉眼睛，这里也可以适当使用一些息风止痉药来缓解。最后，孩子还表现出足少阳胆经证的一些症状，如头痛耳鸣等，这些都需要综合调理。希望家长们能重视起孩子的日常保健，预防为主，治疗为辅。

Translation
Recently, I encountered a parent in the outpatient clinic whose child showed obvious symptoms of contagious diseases in children, with persistent high fever and loss of appetite. I suggested that parents should pay attention to keeping the child's diet light on a regular basis. In terms of medication, some gentle and flexible remedies could be considered, and it was important to tuck in the buttocks to avoid aggravating the condition. At the same time, the child presented symptoms of the heat-induced ascending of stomach qi pattern, manifesting as dry mouth and tongue, and constipation, which were also related to diet. Additionally, I noticed that the child had some issues with athlete's foot, possibly due to damp weather, and it was recommended to keep the feet dry and clean. Furthermore, the child's ocular disease was severe, with frequent rubbing of eyes due to red, wet and ulcerative eyelid, and some wind-extinguishing and convulsion-resolving medicines could be appropriately used to alleviate the condition. Finally, the child exhibited symptoms of the gallbladder meridian pattern of foot-Shaoyang, such as headache and tinnitus, all of which required comprehensive regulation. It is hoped that parents will attach importance to their children's daily health care, with prevention as the priority and treatment as a supplement.
