Translation
In exploring the clinical manifestations and treatment strategies for shallow breathing and hypothyroidism, we find that patients often exhibit significant physical weakness and shortness of breath, which are signs of shallow breathing. For the treatment of hypothyroidism, using pulling manipulation combined with the formula to remove toxins and resolve sores can effectively alleviate symptoms of neck swelling, while also addressing digestive problems caused by the blood stasis in the stomach and intestines pattern. During treatment, it is essential to clear heart fire and remove summer heat to regulate internal damp-heat and prevent the progression of the disease. Additionally, for masses in the liver caused by emotional distress, combined with the principle of holding the head as if suspended from above during treatment, it helps restore normal physiological functions of the patient, achieving the effect of treating both the tip and root. Through the aforementioned comprehensive therapy, clinical efficacy has significantly improved.
