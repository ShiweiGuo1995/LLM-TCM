在临床实践中，我们观察到某些疾病晚期患者出现“回光返照”现象，此现象常与“中焦阴虚证”及“热盛伤阴证”密切相关。针对此类病症，“辨证论治”显得尤为重要，通过仔细分析病情，我们可以发现“肝郁血瘀证”亦是导致上述症状的关键因素之一。治疗上，需灵活运用中药方剂，例如采用“冷服”方式以减少药物对胃肠道的刺激，并结合针灸疗法，特别是“豹文刺”技术，以促进气血运行，缓解“肝郁血瘀证”。此外，从“五行胜复”的理论出发，我们还需考虑疾病的整体平衡，确保治疗方案既能针对当前症状，又能调整体内五行之间的相互关系，从而达到标本兼治的效果。

Translation
In clinical practice, we observe the "false spirit" phenomenon in some patients with advanced diseases, which is often closely related to the "yin deficiency of the spleen and stomach pattern" and the "exuberant heat damaging yin pattern". For such syndromes, "treatment based on pattern differentiation" is particularly important. Through careful analysis of the condition, we can find that the "liver qi stagnation with blood stasis pattern" is also one of the key factors leading to the aforementioned symptoms. In treatment, it is necessary to flexibly apply Chinese herbal formulas, for example, using the "take cold" method to reduce the stimulation of drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, and combining acupuncture therapy, especially the "leopard-spot needling" technique, to promote the circulation of qi and blood, alleviating the "liver qi stagnation with blood stasis pattern". Additionally, starting from the theory of "the five elements overcome and retaliate", we also need to consider the overall balance of the disease, ensuring that the treatment plan not only targets the current symptoms but also adjusts the mutual relationships among the five elements within the body, thus achieving the effect of treating both the tip and root.
