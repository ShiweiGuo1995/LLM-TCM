Translation
In exploring the clinical manifestations of Qi-tonifying and collapse-preventing and Liver Qi affecting the spleen pattern, we found that patients often present with symptoms such as soliloquy and restless fetus. By combining meridian and acupuncture point therapy, the stimulation of specific points through needling is performed to achieve the purpose of clearing heart fire and draining dampness, as well as clearing the stomach and reducing fire. Studies have shown that this comprehensive treatment method has significant efficacy in improving the aforementioned symptoms and can effectively alleviate related discomforts caused by the Liver Qi affecting the spleen pattern. However, it is necessary to pay attention to individual differences in practical applications and avoid excessive treatment leading to adverse reactions.
