Translation
In this season full of spring vitality, let's talk about the relationship between the ten heavenly stems in Traditional Chinese Medicine and human health. TCM holds that the ten heavenly stems not only correspond to the changes of the five elements in nature but are also closely related to our twelve regular meridians. For example, when regulating the body, if encountering a disease like bone slot wind, it is necessary to treat it through the method of clearing heat and transforming dampness in the three jiao. In daily life, maintaining good living habits, such as dropping the buttocks, can promote the circulation of qi and blood, achieving the effect of harmonizing the Ying nutrients and regenerating new tissues. At the same time, attention should be paid to emotional management, avoiding excessive sadness because sadness consumes the qi, which is detrimental to health. Of course, sometimes to achieve better therapeutic effects, inducing vomiting to refresh the mind is an indispensable method. In summary, TCM emphasizes the holistic concept, let us carefully experience the application of these theories in life.
