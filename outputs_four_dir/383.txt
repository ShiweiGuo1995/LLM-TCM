暑瘟病与暑病在临床表现上存在诸多相似之处，但其本质在于精气亏虚证与命门之火不足，导致机体出现一系列寒热错杂症状。针对此类病症，我们采用利尿开窍法以促进传化功能，同时结合温阳益气治疗命门之火不足，有效缓解了患者的热淋症状。此外，在处理冻僵患者时，亦需重视暑瘟病与热淋之间的关联，综合运用上述方法，方能取得较好疗效。通过本研究，我们进一步明确了暑瘟病与精气亏虚证、热淋等症之间的内在联系，为临床诊治提供了新的思路。

Translation
The clinical manifestations of summer heat pestilence and summer-heat disorder share many similarities, but their essence lies in the essence and qi deficiency pattern and insufficiency of the fire of the gate of life, leading to a series of mixed cold and hot symptoms. For such conditions, we adopt orifice-opening methods to promote transmission and transformation functions, while simultaneously combining yang tonification and qi supplementation to treat the insufficiency of the fire of the gate of life, effectively alleviating the patient's heat strangury symptoms. Additionally, when dealing with patients suffering from systemic hypothermia, it is also necessary to pay attention to the relationship between summer heat pestilence and heat strangury, and comprehensively apply the aforementioned methods to achieve better therapeutic outcomes. Through this study, we have further clarified the intrinsic connections between summer heat pestilence, essence and qi deficiency pattern, heat strangury, and other syndromes, providing new ideas for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
