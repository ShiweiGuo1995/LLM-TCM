Translation
In TCM theory, for patients presenting symptoms such as cloudy urine and deviated tongue, we can regulate by clearing heat and transforming dampness in the three jiao while using tranquillizers to help stabilize emotions. For spleen deficiency with heat pattern, we can adopt the principle of reinforcing the mother (element) for deficiency pattern to harmonize the body's yin and yang balance. During treatment, Qi controls body fluids is particularly important, which helps improve symptoms. The six origins theory provides a framework for understanding the overall development of diseases. Through the comprehensive application of these methods, the patient's discomfort can be effectively alleviated.
