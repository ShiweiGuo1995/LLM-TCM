This article aims to explore the causative factors, pathogenesis of Tiansheng Dou and Chiyoudan, and their treatment strategies. Based on clinical observations, Tiansheng Dou is often due to external infection by seasonal pathogenic factors with internal co-morbidity of stomach fire exuberance pattern, leading to disharmony of qi and blood, symptoms including fever, aversion to cold, and dense rash eruptions. In treatment, it is advisable to use dosage forms that clear heat and remove toxins, supplemented by methods that tonify qi and nourish yin to harmonize the body's yin and yang. Additionally, for patients with endogenous dryness and summer-heat patterns, attention should be paid to the function of the heart governing the bright spirit to prevent restlessness and aggravation of the condition. Research indicates that reasonably adjusting compound medicines and emphasizing individual differences are key to improving therapeutic effects.
