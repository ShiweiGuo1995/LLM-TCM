在本次研究中，我们针对温邪侵袭肺卫证患者进行了详细的问诊与脉诊，发现其临床表现主要为自汗、咳喘等症。结合患者的症状和舌象，我们推测此症可能由胆经郁热证演变而来，治疗时需注重祛化浊，清泄胆经之郁热。同时，患者伴有嗳气、胃脘胀满等症状，提示可能存在脾胃功能失调，治疗过程中需兼顾调理脾胃。对于病情较重者，应辅以补血固脱之法，以防止病情进一步恶化。通过上述分析，我们认为温邪侵袭肺卫证的治疗应在辨证施治的基础上，注重整体调节，方能达到最佳疗效。

Translation
In this study, we conducted detailed inquiry and pulse-taking for patients with the pattern of Warm Evil Attacking Lung Defence, and found that their clinical manifestations were mainly spontaneous sweating and coughing and wheezing. Combining the symptoms and tongue manifestations of the patients, we speculated that this pattern might have evolved from the Stagnant Heat in the Gallbladder Meridian pattern; thus, treatment should focus on removing turbidity and clearing the stagnant heat in the gallbladder meridian. At the same time, the patients also exhibited symptoms such as belching and distension in the stomach cavity, indicating possible dysfunction of the spleen and stomach; therefore, during the treatment process, it is necessary to also regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach. For those with more severe conditions, blood tonification and prevention of collapse should be supplemented to prevent the condition from further deteriorating. Through the above analysis, we believe that the treatment of Warm Evil Attacking Lung Defence should focus on overall regulation based on pattern differentiation to achieve the best therapeutic effect.
