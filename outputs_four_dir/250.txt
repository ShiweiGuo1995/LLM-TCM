最近有一位朋友向我咨询，她身上出现了奇怪的蝶斑疮，非常困扰。我建议她可以试试以毒攻毒的方法，或许能缓解症状。当然，这种方法需要焗服特定的草药，才能达到最佳效果。同时，我也提醒她要注意身体其他部位的情况，比如阴道直肠瘘等，这些都可能是子病犯母的表现。如果出现持续的🗎热证，可能需要考虑用实则泻之的方式调理。当然，每个人的体质不同，具体方案还需要根据个人情况来定。

Translation
Recently, a friend consulted me about strange butterfly-like sores appearing on her body, which troubled her greatly. I suggested she could try fighting poison with poison to alleviate the symptoms. Of course, this method requires taking folk medicines after being infused in hot water to achieve the best results. At the same time, I also reminded her to pay attention to other parts of her body, such as obstetric (rectovaginal) fistulas, which may be manifestations of child’s illness affecting the mother. If there are persistent damp heat accumulation patterns, it might be necessary to adjust by treating excess with purgation/reduction. Of course, everyone's constitution is different, and specific plans still need to be determined based on individual conditions.
