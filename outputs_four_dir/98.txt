通过对一例肾精亏损导致乳漏反复发作患者的研究发现，该病例在治疗初期表现为血虚肠燥证，采用温阳散寒法治疗效果不佳。进一步辨证分析，认为病因与肝胃不调证密切相关，且存在神气不足的表现。结合“虚则补其母”的原则，最终确定以补益肝肾、调理脾胃为治则，并辅以温补肾阳之法，经过一段时间治疗后，患者症状明显改善。此外，本案例亦提示我们在临床中需重视冬瘟病的发生，以防病情复杂化。

Through the study of a case of recurrent mammary duct fistula caused by deficiency of kidney essence, it was found that in the early stages of treatment, the patient presented with the pattern of intestinal dryness due to blood deficiency, and the therapeutic effect of using the method of warming yang and dissipating cold was unsatisfactory. Further pattern identification analysis revealed that the causative factors were closely related to the pattern of disharmony between the liver and stomach, and there was also a manifestation of insufficiency of spirit. Combining with the principle of reinforcing the mother (element) for deficiency pattern, the final treatment strategy was determined as tonifying liver and kidney, regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach, and supplemented with the method of warming and tonifying kidney yang. After a period of treatment, the patient's symptoms significantly improved. Additionally, this case also prompts us to pay attention to the occurrence of winter pestilence in clinical practice to prevent the condition from becoming complicated.
