Translation
In exploring the treatment strategies for spring febrile disorders, we found that Qi tympanites is closely related to the dysfunction of the liver and gallbladder. By applying the method of clearing heat in the liver and gallbladder, combined with reinforcing and reducing by opening and closing and the use of extra points, the condition can be effectively improved. At the same time, through colour diagnosis, observing changes in the patient's complexion guides clinical treatment, and the reducing method is used to promote the elimination of pathogenic qi from the body. In the specific operational process, reasonably using the needle retention technique enhances therapeutic effects, further improving treatment outcomes. This comprehensive treatment method has achieved significant results in clinical practice.
