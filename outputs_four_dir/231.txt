Translation
In TCM theory, for the regulation of the fire personality constitution, we often use the lower He-sea point therapy to promote the function of the spleen and stomach. At the same time, for the condition of phlegm node of the eyelid, taking folk medicines in multiple times can achieve good therapeutic effects. Additionally, for the masses accumulating below the cardiac region caused by external etiological factors, using blanching to process the herbs combined with the compatibility principle of testicular cancer can better exert the efficacy of the drugs, thereby improving the patient's constitution and treating diseases such as masses in the upper abdomen.
