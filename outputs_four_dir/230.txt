在探讨产后类病时，我们常会遇到肝肾虚火证与痰热蕴肺证等复杂情况，这些病症往往需要通过经络现象来理解其病理机制。对于这类病症的治疗，采用先补后攻的方法是较为稳妥的选择，即首先需调理好患者的体质，再进行针对性的治疗。同时，在治疗过程中，观察阴阳转化的规律也十分重要，这有助于更好地把握病情的发展趋势。值得注意的是，对于特定体质如太阴人而言，使用奇穴进行辅助治疗可能会取得意想不到的效果。这一过程不仅体现了中医辨证施治的原则，也是对传统医学智慧的一种传承与发展。

Translation
In discussing postpartum disorders, we often encounter complex conditions such as liver and kidney yin deficiency pattern and phlegm heat obstructing the lung pattern, which usually require understanding their pathological mechanisms through the meridian phenomena. For treating such conditions, it is advisable to adopt the method of reinforcing healthy qi before removing pathogenic factors, that is, first adjusting the patient's constitution, then conducting targeted treatment. At the same time, observing the patterns of Yin and Yang mutual transformation during the treatment process is also crucial, which helps better grasp the trend of disease progression. It is noteworthy that for specific constitutions such as Taiyin personality, using extra points for auxiliary treatment may achieve unexpected results. This process not only embodies the principle of syndrome differentiation and treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine but also represents the inheritance and development of traditional medical wisdom.
