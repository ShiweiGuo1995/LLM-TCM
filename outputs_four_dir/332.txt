People with wood personality should mainly regulate and nourish in a peaceful manner. For male sterility, methods such as clearing and reducing intestine heat can be used for adjustment, while also paying attention to maintaining the posture of keeping the coccyx upright. When treating infectious warts, the principle of the reducing method can also be referred to, using slow-acting formulas to aid recovery, which is also applicable to diseases of the heart system patterns.
