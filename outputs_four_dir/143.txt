中医认为，人体有八体之说，通过调和这些部位的功能，可以达到治疗疾病的目的。例如，在治疗肝气犯胃证时，我们采用化瘀生新的方法，促进气血运行，同时运用涤痰破结的手段，清除体内痰湿，使脾胃功能恢复正常。在某些情况下，血虚风燥证也会出现，此时需要滋养真阴，散寒燥湿，以恢复机体平衡。通过这些综合治疗方法，可以有效地改善患者的症状，提高生活质量。

Translation
In TCM, there is a theory of eight body parts, and by harmonizing the functions of these parts, the purpose of treating diseases can be achieved. For example, when treating the pattern of Liver qi affecting the stomach, we adopt the method of eliminating stasis and regenerating blood to promote the circulation of Qi and Blood, while using the approach of transforming phlegm and dissipating nodules to eliminate phlegm-dampness in the body, thus restoring the normal function of the spleen and stomach. In some cases, the pattern of Blood deficiency-induced wind dryness may occur; at this time, it is necessary to nourish the true Yin, disperse cold and dry dampness to restore the balance of the body. Through these comprehensive treatment methods, the patient's symptoms can be effectively improved, and the quality of life can be enhanced.
