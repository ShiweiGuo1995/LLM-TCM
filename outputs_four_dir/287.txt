在日常生活中，我们常会遇到中焦热盛证的情况，这时候不妨试试通过温里法来调理身体，同时别忘了在饮食上扶脾祛湿。如果感觉背部不适，或许可以尝试按摩一下背俞穴，对于寒痹有不错的缓解作用。当然，若症状复杂，比如出现了血分证，可能需要在医生指导下使用反佐药来调和。而脚蚓的问题，也可能是体内湿气过重所致，适当的运动和调整生活习惯也很重要。

Translation
In daily life, we often encounter the condition of Excess Heat in the Middle Jiao; at such times, it might be appropriate to try using Warming Interior Methods to regulate the body, while also not forgetting to support the spleen and remove dampness through diet. If you feel discomfort in the back, perhaps you could try massaging the Back-Shu points, which can have a good effect in alleviating Cold Impediment Disorders. Of course, if the symptoms are complex, for example, if a Blood Pattern appears, you may need to use Counteracting Assistant Medicines under the guidance of a doctor. As for the problem of keratotic tinea pedis, it could also be due to excessive dampness inside the body; appropriate exercise and adjustment of living habits are also very important.
