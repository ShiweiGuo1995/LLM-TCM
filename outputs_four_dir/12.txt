Translation
The occurrence of dementia is closely related to the disharmony of the five elements, and in treatment, it is necessary to focus on the balance of yin and yang, using cool-opening formulas that nourish yin and moisten dryness for regulation, avoiding improper diet causing symptoms such as cough during pregnancy. In clinical practice, it has been observed that some patients transform from heat patterns to cold patterns; treatment strategies need to be adjusted accordingly, applying Taiji jin techniques to promote the circulation of qi and blood, achieving the effect of treating both the surface and root.
