最近感受了风寒，出现了气虚外感证，体质较弱时容易出现这种情况。为了调理身体，我选择了清理三焦热来清除体内的湿热。同时，饮食上也需要注意，避免肝气犯胃证的发生，保持情绪舒畅，饮食清淡，肌肤甲错的情况也有所改善。在治疗过程中，我使用了一些祛瘀止血的草药，用蜜丸的形式服用，既方便又有效。对于一些实热便秘的情况，适量使用攻下药也是必要的。在日常生活中，我还注重阴阳平衡，比如在滋阴的同时不忘阴中求阳，这样才能让身体更加健康。

Translation
Recently, I was affected by wind-cold and developed a pattern of qi deficiency with external contraction. This condition tends to occur when the physique is weak. To regulate my body, I chose to clear the heat in the Sanjiao to eliminate damp-heat inside. At the same time, I paid attention to diet to avoid the occurrence of the Liver qi affecting the stomach pattern, maintained a cheerful mood, had a light diet, which also improved the condition of rough, scaly skin. During the treatment process, I used some folk medicines for transforming stasis and stopping bleeding, taken in honeyed pills form, which were both convenient and effective. For some cases of actual heat constipation, it was necessary to use attacking purgative medicines appropriately. In daily life, I also emphasized the balance of Yin and Yang, such as nourishing Yin while not forgetting to seek Yang within Yin, which could make the body healthier.
