Translation
Recently, the weather has been dry, and many friends feel a dry mouth. At this time, we can regulate our body by nourishing Yin and moistening dryness, for example, drinking more water and eating more fruits and vegetables. If you feel unwell, you can try using the needling sensation to guide the smooth flow of meridians and help adjust the balance of Yin and Yang inside the body. At the same time, pay attention to light diet, avoid greasy food leading to greasy tongue coating, which affects the function of spleen and stomach. For some discomfort caused by the phlegm qi stagnation pattern, we can regulate it through techniques such as guiding fire to its origin. Of course, in daily life, we should also pay attention to the prevention of ringworm of the leg, maintaining clean and dry feet. Finally, don't forget to enhance your physique and improve immunity by practicing the twelve divergent meridians, staying away from epidemic febrile disorders.
