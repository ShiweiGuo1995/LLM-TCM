Translation
Paediatric schistosomiasis should be treated early to avoid progression to the wind toxin accumulating in the skin pattern, a condition commonly seen in children. Treatment should apply the method of clearing heat and transforming dampness in the three jiao to resolve the pathogenic factors within. Postpartum lochia disturbing the heart mind also requires vigilance; postpartum women are prone to weakness and should focus on conditioning. If nipple eczema occurs, it must not be underestimated as it may lead to infection. A tight pulse is frequently observed during diagnosis, indicating the presence of cold in the body. The formation of yin swelling is also related to cold-dampness and should be treated with warming yang and dissipating cold. The flipping manipulation is commonly used in tuina to promote the circulation of qi and blood and alleviate symptoms.
