最近有朋友问我关于足厥阴肝经的问题，其实这条经络与我们的日常健康息息相关。比如我之前遇到一位患者，他的面部出现了一个粉瘤，经过辨证施治，我发现是由于体内湿气过重导致的。在治疗上，我采用了芳香泄浊的方法，通过一些具有挥发性的药材来帮助他清除体内的湿气，效果不错。另外，最近疫病频发，很多人都出现了腹痛的症状，这可能与风性主动有关，即外界环境的变化对身体的影响。我还听说有些新生儿因为脐风的问题困扰，这是一种非常棘手的情况，需要特别小心处理。对于这些情况，有时我会建议患者将某些药材另煎，以确保药效的最大化。总之，中医讲究的是整体调理，希望我的分享能帮助大家更好地理解中医，维护自身健康。

Recently, a friend asked me about the issues related to the Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin. In fact, this meridian is closely related to our daily health. For example, I once encountered a patient who had a skin tumor on his face. After pattern identification and treatment, I found that it was caused by excessive dampness inside the body. In treatment, I adopted the method of transforming turbidity with aroma, using some volatile herbs to help him eliminate the dampness inside his body, which was quite effective. Additionally, recently there have been frequent cases of epidemic pestilence, and many people have experienced abdominal pain, which may be related to the fact that Wind causes movement, meaning the impact of environmental changes on the body. I also heard that some newborns are troubled by umbilical wind, a very tricky situation that requires special care in handling. For these conditions, sometimes I suggest patients decoct certain herbs separately to ensure the maximization of their efficacy. In summary, Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes overall regulation. I hope my sharing can help everyone better understand TCM and maintain their own health.
