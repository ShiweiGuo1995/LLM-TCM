在探讨食毒类病与钩虫病的鉴别诊断时，我们发现两者在临床表现上存在一定的相似性，但通过深入分析患者的症状，如畏光及证候相兼等现象，结合患者体质状态，可以有效区分。特别是在辨证施治过程中，对于表现为遏卫阳证或肝郁痰火证的患者，采用扶正补气法治疗显得尤为重要。此外，在处理一些复杂病例时，如伴有葡萄疫症状的情况，需要特别注意证候相兼的问题，以确保治疗方案的全面性和针对性。

Translation
In the process of differentiating and diagnosing food poisoning and ancylostomiasis, we found certain similarities in their clinical manifestations. However, by deeply analyzing symptoms such as photophobia and concurrent patterns, combined with the patient's physical condition, effective differentiation can be achieved. Especially during syndrome differentiation and treatment, for patients presenting with Yang pattern or liver stagnation with phlegm fire pattern, it is particularly important to adopt methods to tonify qi. Additionally, when dealing with complex cases such as those accompanied by purpura, special attention should be paid to concurrent patterns to ensure the comprehensiveness and targeted nature of the treatment plan.
