Translation
In the scorching summer, summer heat patterns frequently occur; everyone should pay attention to preventing heatstroke and cooling down. It is appropriate to use exterior-releasing formulas with pungent-cool properties, such as Yin Qiao San. Meanwhile, in terms of diet, one should also be cautious to avoid the occurrence of yang deficiency of the spleen and stomach pattern; more warming and tonifying foods should be consumed. If you feel unwell, acupoint application can be attempted to help alleviate symptoms. For the heat blocking the pericardium pattern, in addition to drug therapy, suppositories can also be used to enhance therapeutic effects. In daily life, we should also focus on the lung governing upward and outward diffusion function, maintaining smooth breathing to prevent diseases.
