Translation
In daily life, we often encounter common health issues such as dizziness during pregnancy and damage to paired meridians. For these conditions, we can try using moxibustion to alleviate symptoms, while also combining blistering moxibustion and dispersing phlegm to clear orifices for regulation. Additionally, observing sublingual veins is an important method to understand the body's condition. If there are issues of dispersing nodules/masses, then using formulas that open the orifices with cold-property ingredients and appropriate treatments become particularly crucial. Through these methods, we can perform preliminary self-regulation at home; however, if symptoms persist or worsen, it is advisable to seek medical attention promptly.
