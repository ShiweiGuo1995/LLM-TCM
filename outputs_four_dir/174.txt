Translation
In discussing the treatment of abdominal mass diseases, we often encounter the heart blood deficiency pattern, at which time using the method of transforming stasis and regulating the spleen can effectively improve symptoms. For the management of fistulas, the skin-stretching insertion technique is a method worth recommending; it can gently expand the acupoint to reduce patient pain. Meanwhile, in drug selection, sweet flavor herbs can tonify qi and blood, combined with bland diuretic herbs to help regulate excessive dampness within the body. In pulse observation, the skipping pulse often indicates urgent illness, requiring timely intervention. Through these comprehensive treatment methods, we can better address the challenges of complex diseases.
