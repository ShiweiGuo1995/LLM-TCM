This study aims to explore the application of water processing and calcination in treating the fire toxin pattern and their effects on tonifying liver qi and essence and marrow. Through clinical observation and experimental analysis, we found that using methods to concurrently release both exterior and interior combined with medicated thread can effectively alleviate symptoms of relaxing and tucking in the hips and improve the overall condition of patients with the fire toxin pattern. Additionally, the research reveals that such treatments have significant effects on enhancing the body's immunity and promoting the recovery of damaged tissues. Experimental data further confirm that the rational use of the aforementioned methods can better achieve the goal of treating both exterior and interior aspects of the disease, providing new ideas and solutions for clinical treatment.
