Translation
In the treatment of coldness accumulated under the skin, we often adopt blistering moxibustion to achieve the effect of warming meridians and dissipating cold. At the same time, for patients with heart and spleen heat accumulation pattern accompanied by symptoms such as a bitter taste in the mouth, we need to use it cautiously to prevent needle shock. In dealing with Yin jaundice, following the principle of treating the root in remissive stages, it is particularly important to adjust the constitution fundamentally to solve the problem.
