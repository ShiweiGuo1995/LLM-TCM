在探讨祛痰剂的应用时，我们首先需明确患者的具体证候，如脾气虚水停证与肾风等。通过观察脉象，牢脉往往提示体内有痰湿阻滞，此时采用呼吸补泻手法以调整脏腑功能尤为重要。同时，治疗过程中还需注意情绪调节，思胜恐的思想指导有助于增强患者的心理抵抗力。对于阴阳气血津液精髓证类的复杂病症，需综合运用多种治疗方法，确保调理过程中的平衡，避免病情反复。在整个治疗过程中，医患双方需紧密合作，共同应对疾病带来的挑战。

Translation
In discussing the application of phlegm-eliminating formulas, we first need to clearly identify the specific patterns of the patient, such as the spleen deficiency with water retention pattern and kidney wind. Through pulse observation, a firm pulse often indicates the presence of phlegm-dampness obstruction within the body; at this time, it is particularly important to use respiratory reinforcing and reducing techniques to adjust the functions of the zang-fu organs. Meanwhile, during the treatment process, attention should also be paid to emotional regulation, with the thought of thinking prevails over fear guiding patients to enhance their psychological resilience. For complex diseases characterized by patterns of yin, yang, qi, blood, bodily fluids, essence, and marrow, multiple treatment methods must be comprehensively applied to ensure balance during the adjustment process and prevent recurrence of the condition. Throughout the entire treatment process, both medical practitioners and patients need to closely collaborate, jointly addressing the challenges brought about by the disease.
