本文通过对一例暑病患者的临床观察，探讨了其发病机制及治疗策略。患者表现为冷痛，结合脉象及舌象分析，辨证为暑病，且存在肺热津伤证与逆传心包证。据《黄帝内经》所述，“血为气之母”，故在治疗上需兼顾调理气血，采用祛暑清热法，辅以养阴生津之品。同时，考虑到心肝火旺证，治疗过程中还需注重清心泻肝，以期达到标本兼治的效果。此外，对于伏邪未尽的情况，亦需适时采取相应措施，防止病情反复。综上所述，对暑病的诊治需综合考虑多方面因素，方能取得良好疗效。

This article discusses the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of a patient with summer-heat disorder through clinical observation. The patient presented with cold pain. By analyzing the pulse conditions and tongue manifestations, the condition was identified as summer-heat disorder, involving patterns of lung heat and yin deficiency and pathogenic warmth entering the pericardium. According to "Blood is the mother of qi" in The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon, it is necessary to regulate and harmonize qi and blood in treatment, employing heat-clearing methods to eliminate summer heat, supplemented by moistening and nourishing yin and thin body fluids. Meanwhile, considering the pattern of fire hyperactivity of the heart and liver, it is also important to clear heat in the heart and liver during the treatment process, aiming for a comprehensive approach to treating both the tip and root. Furthermore, for cases where latent pathogenic qi remains, corresponding measures should be taken appropriately to prevent recurrence of the disease. In summary, the diagnosis and treatment of summer-heat disorder require consideration of multiple factors to achieve good therapeutic effects.
