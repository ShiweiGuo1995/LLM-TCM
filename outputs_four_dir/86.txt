Translation
In discussing the syndrome of dryness easily damaging the lung and the treatment strategy of warming and tonifying lung Yang, we observe that patients often present with oppressive pain and a pale purple tongue, which are manifestations of dysfunction in lung function. Combining clinical observations, the use of point injection therapy can effectively improve the aforementioned symptoms. Additionally, for patients with the Taiyang blood retention pattern, it is necessary to comprehensively consider their Qi and Blood circulation status and adopt methods to harmonize the middle jiao and calm the mind to regulate the body. It is noteworthy that during the treatment process, the adjustment of patients with mild malnutrition with food stagnation should not be neglected, as it is closely related to overall health. Through the above methods, we aim to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and root, thereby further improving clinical efficacy.
