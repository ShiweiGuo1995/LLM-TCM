最近有朋友问我关于手脚冰凉的问题，说是一到冬天手足厥冷就特别严重，晚上睡觉时还会出现血脉不畅的情况，这其实是气血运行不畅导致的，中医认为这与六郁有关，尤其是气郁会导致血随气逆。在日常生活中，我们可以通过推拿复合手法类来缓解症状，比如轻轻按摩可以促进血液循环，同时要注意关门不利，避免寒气入侵。如果情况较为严重，可能需要通过针灸等方法调整体内气血，有时医生会用到代脉来判断病情。另外，平时也可以适当采用报刺法以达到疏通经络的目的。总之，保持良好的生活习惯和合理的饮食结构对于改善这类问题非常关键。

Recently, a friend asked me about the problem of cold hands and feet, saying that it becomes particularly severe in winter when there is a serious case of cold limbs, and during sleep, there is a situation of blood circulation not being smooth, which is actually caused by the poor circulation of Qi and Blood. In TCM, this is related to the Six Stagnations, especially Qi stagnation can lead to Blood flowing with rebellious Qi. In daily life, we can alleviate symptoms through Compound Tuina manipulations, for example, gentle massage can promote blood circulation, while also paying attention to the water gate failing to operate, to avoid the invasion of cold pathogenic factors. If the condition is more severe, it may be necessary to adjust the internal Qi and Blood through methods such as acupuncture, sometimes doctors will use Regularly Intermittent Pulse to judge the condition. Additionally, one can appropriately adopt Successive Trigger Needling to achieve the purpose of unblocking the meridians. In short, maintaining good living habits and a reasonable dietary structure is very critical for improving such problems.
