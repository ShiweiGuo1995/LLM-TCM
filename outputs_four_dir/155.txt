最近在门诊中遇到一位患者，他长期受着顽癣的困扰，皮肤状况时好时坏。我给他进行了详细的望闻问切后发现，他的体质属于血虚生风证，治疗上需要固涩止带，调理气血。另外，我还发现他的脊柱有些问题，于是采用了一些脊柱推拿手法类的方法来帮助他恢复健康。在他的日常生活中，我建议他保持良好的饮食习惯，比如多吃一些养肝的食物，因为肝脏与胆气相通，对身体的健康有着重要的影响。同时，他还有一些痞满的症状，这可能是由于饮食不当引起的，所以要注意调整饮食结构。最后，希望他在生活中能够保持乐观的心态，这对于疾病的康复也是非常重要的。

Translation
Recently, I encountered a patient in the outpatient clinic who has been suffering from chronic psoriasis for a long time, with fluctuating skin conditions. After performing a detailed diagnosis through observation, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation, I found that his constitution belongs to the pattern of blood deficiency stirring wind. Treatment should focus on securing the Chong meridian and stopping leucorrhea, regulating and harmonizing qi and blood. Additionally, I discovered some issues with his spine, so I employed spinal Tuina manipulation techniques to help him recover. In his daily life, I advised him to maintain good dietary habits, such as eating more foods that nourish the liver, because the liver and gallbladder qi are interconnected, having an important impact on health. At the same time, he also exhibits symptoms of gastric stuffiness, which may be caused by improper diet, so it is necessary to adjust his dietary structure. Finally, I hope he can maintain an optimistic attitude in life, which is also very important for disease recovery.
