This study aims to explore the similarities and differences in clinical manifestations and treatment strategies between Heart Vessels Stasis Pattern and Qi Stagnation Induced Water Retention Pattern, with a particular focus on the application effects of coordinating medicines in such conditions. The research indicates that patients with Heart Vessels Stasis Pattern often present with symptoms of high fever, while Qi Stagnation Induced Water Retention Pattern is characterized prominently by Blood Stasis Obstructing the Uterus Pattern. By analyzing the pathological mechanisms of the Sanjiao Meridian Pattern, it further reveals the close relationship between Essence and Qi, and proposes an innovative treatment plan for Blood Strangury, emphasizing the crucial role of coordinating medicines in regulating the balance of Essence Qi within the body. The results show that the rational use of coordinating medicines can effectively alleviate the above patterns and improve clinical efficacy.
