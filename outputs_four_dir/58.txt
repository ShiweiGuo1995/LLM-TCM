Translation
In the discussion of disease differentiation and eliminating pathogenic factors to reinforce healthy qi as therapeutic principles, we find that for snake skin-like ichthyosis disorder, characterized by rough, scaly skin, with a heavy and turbid nature, combined with symptoms of the Conception Vessel pattern and loss of voice during pregnancy, using the theory of intangible masses for comprehensive analysis can provide a more thorough understanding of the condition, thereby formulating a more precise treatment plan. In this process, it is essential to emphasize the regulation of yin-yang balance within the body to achieve the purpose of treating both the tip and root.
