Translation
This study aims to explore the clinical application of distinguishing between deficiency and excess in the treatment of paralysis, combined with external application of plasters, for different patterns such as Yang deficiency induced water retention pattern, Lung heat and yin deficiency pattern, and Heat blocking the pericardium pattern. Although stinking field snail is not used directly, it is mentioned that its cold nature can be used as an auxiliary reference. Formulas that clear heat in the zang-fu organs also play a significant role in the treatment of such diseases, providing more precise guidance for clinical practice through comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of various patterns.
