Translation
In exploring asthma, we find that the nail-pressing insertion technique has significant effects in alleviating symptoms. However, for certain patients presenting with true excess with false deficiency pattern, this method alone may be insufficient, and it is necessary to combine therapies such as phlegm elimination and dampness transformation, and orifice opening. For discomfort caused by excessive stomach fire, appropriately adjusting dietary structure to reduce spicy and stimulating foods is also a key aspect of treatment. Additionally, spermatorrhoea is relatively common among male patients, which is related to kidney qi not being firmly retained. As surgical conditions, axillary abscess and vulvar ulceration should also be given due attention in clinical practice; their treatment often requires a combination of internal and external therapies to achieve ideal therapeutic outcomes.
