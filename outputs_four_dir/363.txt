The pattern of disharmony between the spleen and stomach often manifests symptoms such as chest stuffiness and abdominal distension; treatment should focus on warming and tonifying spleen yang to promote the circulation of qi and blood.

The house of central essence refers to the gallbladder, which is exteriorly and interiorly related to the liver; when treating night crying, attention should be paid to harmonizing the heart meridian of hand-Shaoyin, relieving stagnation, and calming the mind. Yang deficiency leading to cold is a common manifestation of physical constitution; by warming and tonifying kidney yang, improvement can be achieved.
