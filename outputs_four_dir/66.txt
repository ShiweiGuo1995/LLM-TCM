In exploring the pattern of Stomach qi deficiency, we found that the method of Clearing and reducing stomach heat has significant therapeutic effects on gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by mushroom poisoning. Meanwhile, clinical observations indicate that Clearing heat in the heart and lung and harmonizing the Five flavours can also effectively alleviate symptoms, with the mechanism being the adjustment of Yin-Yang balance within the body to achieve the effect of dispelling pathogenic factors and restoring normalcy. Furthermore, the appearance of a Bound pulse is commonly observed in such patients, suggesting complex conditions that require the integration of Metal is characterized by yielding and changing theory for syndrome differentiation and treatment. For severe cases, Fire-clearing purgation becomes a necessary measure to achieve the effect of dispelling pathogenic factors and restoring normalcy. In summary, adopting multiple therapeutic methods concurrently can enhance treatment outcomes and promote patient recovery.
