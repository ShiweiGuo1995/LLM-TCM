在治疗膝部疾病时，如膝痈与黄瓜痈，采用治风法结合呼吸补泻手法，可以有效改善局部气血不畅的情况。对于脾虚困证患者，除了调理脾胃外，还需关注固表止汗，以防外邪侵袭。中消病的发生与手太阳小肠经的功能失调有关，通过疏通经络、调和阴阳，能更好地控制病情发展。

Translation
In treating knee diseases such as knee abscess and paravertebral abscess, using removing wind methods combined with reinforcing and reducing by breathing techniques can effectively improve local Qi and Blood stagnation. For patients with spleen deficiency pattern, in addition to regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach, attention should also be paid to astringing sweating and securing the exterior to prevent external pathogens from invading. The occurrence of wasting of the middle jiao is related to the dysfunction of the small intestine meridian of hand-Taiyang; by dredging the meridians and collaterals and harmonizing Yin-Yang, the progression of the disease can be better controlled.
