Translation
Patients with short stature often develop delayed growth and development due to the kidney yin deficiency pattern. If they exhibit symptoms of true cardiac pain, it may involve lesions in the lung meridian of hand-Taiyin. At this time, one needs to differentiate between the qi and blood deficiency pattern and manifestations such as cold sweats, while simultaneously observing the tongue manifestations like a crimson tongue, to comprehensively assess the possibility of the kidney yin deficiency pattern and the qi failing to secure the urinary bladder pattern.
