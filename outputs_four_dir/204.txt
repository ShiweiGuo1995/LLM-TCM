Translation
In TCM theory, when Yang prevails, Yin fluids will be consumed; this phenomenon is commonly seen in clinical settings as lochia disturbing the heart mind postpartum, which requires timely regulation. The theory of the five elements overcome and retaliate guides our understanding of the occurrence and development of diseases, such as clearing heat and eliminating dryness to treat the surface while simultaneously regulating the deficiency cold of the spleen and stomach patterns to promote the balance of Yin and Yang within the body. For the treatment of Taiyang water retention patterns, corresponding therapeutic methods should be employed to restore the functions of the zang-fu organs. Additionally, heel pain and mumps are also common clinical conditions; both require a combination of specific patient constitutions and causative factors for pattern identification and treatment to achieve the therapeutic goal.
