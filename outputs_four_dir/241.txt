Translation
The pattern of disharmony between the spleen and stomach often manifests as symptoms such as chest stuffiness, poor appetite, etc. During treatment, methods to regulate and harmonize qi and blood are commonly used to improve these symptoms. For cases of somnolence accompanied by stomach heat, a combination of formulas that clear and reduce stomach heat with those that eliminate summer heat can be used for adjustment. In postpartum care, tonifying qi and astringing the breast milk is crucial, which helps in restoring physical constitution. If constipation or difficulty in defecation occurs, congestion-clearing and qi-circulating purgation should be applied to promote smooth bowel movements. Fire needling therapy can also be utilized in certain situations to stimulate the meridians and assist in treating the aforementioned symptoms.
