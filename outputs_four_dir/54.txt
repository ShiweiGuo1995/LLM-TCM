Translation
In daily life, we often encounter some common but troubling minor ailments. For example, "thunder head wind," a type of headache, can indeed be very distressing. In fact, through the "slow-shifting manipulation" in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), we can alleviate these discomforts. At the same time, we should also pay attention to "regulating and balancing yin and yang" to maintain the body's balanced state. "Stomach fire pattern" often makes us feel dry mouth and tongue; at this time, we need to appropriately adjust our dietary habits and avoid overly spicy foods. "Joint impediment" is a kind of joint disease; we should pay attention to keeping warm in daily life to prevent cold from invading. The emotion of the lung is grief, when mood is low, our respiratory system will also be affected, so maintaining a pleasant mood is very important for health. Excess of the five emotions can lead to dysfunction of bodily functions, so we should learn to control our emotions. "Ascending, descending, entering and exiting" are the basic forms of life activities; we should pay attention to regular living schedules to maintain good health.
