Translation
In daily life, we often encounter some minor illnesses and pains, such as the gynecological issue of uterine heat syndrome; actually, it can be effectively alleviated through tendon-flicking manipulation and formulas that regulate blood. Of course, during the treatment process, we should also pay attention to the application of formulas that release the exterior and interior, so as to achieve both internal and external treatment. For throat discomfort such as posterior pharyngeal abscess, using the method of opening the orifices with aroma can quickly alleviate symptoms. Meanwhile, when performing acupuncture therapy, using stainless steel needles is safer and more hygienic. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes that Wei-defense circulates outside the vessels, which means paying attention to the combination of treatments on the surface and inside the body, thus better promoting physical recovery. I hope these simple TCM knowledge can help everyone understand and apply them better in their daily lives.
