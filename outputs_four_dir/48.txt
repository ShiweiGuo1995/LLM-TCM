Translation
This article explores the similarities and differences in clinical manifestations between liver accumulation and penile cancer, and analyzes their pathological mechanisms in conjunction with the theory of mutual克制of the five elements. In treatment strategies, for the patterns of exuberance of toxic/pathogenic/ fire heat and interior fire toxin, blood-cooling hemostatic medicines with effects of clearing heat and removing toxins are used, while drying formulas are also employed to alleviate wind-caused movement symptoms, aiming to comprehensively adjust the balance of yin and yang within the body and promote disease recovery.
