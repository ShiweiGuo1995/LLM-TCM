Translation
In daily life, we often encounter some seemingly ordinary symptoms that conceal health risks. For example, some friends may experience a pungent taste in their mouth, which could be a manifestation of disharmony in the spleen and stomach functions. When discussing how to regulate these conditions, it's not only necessary to differentiate diseases but also to achieve internal-external unity by adjusting lifestyles and dietary habits to attain the effect of shen-qi movement. For pregnant women, changes in the pregnancy pulse are particularly important as they help us understand the health status of both the mother and the fetus. During the treatment process, the arrival of qi is crucial in acupuncture therapy and also an important sign for patients to feel the therapeutic effects. Of course, when selecting medicinal materials, medicinal processing is also a discipline; only high-quality herbs can better exert their efficacy. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine is not just about curing diseases but also nurturing the body and mind. Let's learn more about traditional Chinese medicine together and jointly safeguard our health.
