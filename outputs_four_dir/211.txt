Translation
Individuals with constitutional insufficiency often feel lassitude and lack of strength; in treatment, the principle of treating deficiency with reinforcement should be followed, using formulas that clear heat in the qi and blood for regulation, while simultaneously combining the point-pricking method to promote blood circulation. For symptoms such as wasting and thirst disorders and puffiness and swelling during menstruation, attention should be paid to seeking stillness in movement, harmonizing yin and yang balance. If scanty menstruation occurs, it is also necessary to start from the whole body, adjust the constitution to achieve harmony between qi and blood.
