最近在写关于肩周炎的文章，提到了拿揉法对于缓解肩部疼痛很有帮助。同时发现很多人不了解反治法，其实它在治疗如寒饮伏肺证这类病症时非常有效。我还想提醒大家，如果出现脾气虚证的症状，一定要及时调理，避免病情加重。另外，精气不足也是现代人常见的问题，希望大家能注重养生保健。对于那些有瘀阻胃络证的朋友，饮食上也需要注意，少吃辛辣刺激的食物。最后，太阳蓄血证虽然少见，但也需要我们关注，及时辨证施治。

Translation
Recently, while writing an article about frozen shoulder, I mentioned that the grasping-kneading manipulation is very helpful for relieving shoulder pain. At the same time, I found that many people do not understand paradoxical treatment, which is actually very effective in treating patterns such as retention of cold fluids in the lung. I also want to remind everyone that if symptoms of spleen qi deficiency pattern appear, it is necessary to adjust in time to avoid the condition from worsening. Additionally, insufficiency of essence qi is a common problem among modern people, and I hope everyone can pay attention to health preservation. For those with stasis obstructing the stomach collaterals pattern, they should also pay attention to their diet and eat less spicy and stimulating food. Finally, although Taiyang blood retention pattern is rare, we still need to pay attention to it and identify and treat it in time.
