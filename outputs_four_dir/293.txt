燥和中与贴棉法是治疗气虚血凝证的重要手段，通过调理脾胃以达到燥湿化痰的效果，同时采用贴棉法促进局部血液循环。手少阳三焦经与暑温密切相关，暑温病程中可采用单手进针法刺激手少阳三焦经以清热解暑，脾其华在唇，故唇色变化亦可作为诊断依据之一。在临床应用中，对于暑温患者，使用铍针刺络放血也是有效的辅助治疗方法。

Translation
Dryness and harmony of the middle-jiao along with cotton-paste application are crucial methods for treating Qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern, achieving dampness transformation and phlegm dissipation by regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach, while simultaneously promoting local blood circulation through cotton-paste application. The Sanjiao meridian of hand-Shaoyang is closely related to summer heat febrile disorders; during the course of summer heat pestilence, single-hand needle insertion can be used to stimulate this meridian for clearing heat and dispelling summer-heat. The lustre of the spleen shows in the lips, hence changes in lip color can also serve as one of the diagnostic criteria. In clinical practice, for patients suffering from summer heat pestilence, using sword-like needle for bloodletting is also an effective auxiliary treatment method.
