This article explores the application of purgative formulas in treating animal/insect bites and reproductive system diseases, and verifies their therapeutic effects through clinical observations. During the diagnosis process, we adopted methods such as pulse diagnosis and inquiry, discovering symptoms of nocturnal emissions and simultaneous dysfunction in the pairing between the liver and gallbladder. Based on this, we incorporated principles of regulating qi and harmonizing the Ying nutrients, and circulating blood and relaxing tendons into our treatment plan, aiming to improve the patient's overall condition. The experimental results show that this comprehensive therapy has significant effects in improving the patient's symptoms.
