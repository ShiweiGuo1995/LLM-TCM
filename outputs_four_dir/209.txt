最近天气变化无常，不少朋友出现了眼针疗法可以缓解的不适症状。比如我最近就遇到了一位朋友，他总是感觉短气，特别是在子丑寅卯这些时辰，也就是我们常说的十二支。我建议他尝试一下眼针疗法，同时提醒他要注意饮食，避免食复，因为过度饮食可能会加重病情。他还提到自己有消谷善饥的情况，这可能是脾胃功能失调的表现。另外，我还听说有一种情况叫做阳厥，表现为突然昏倒、四肢冰冷等症状，需要及时调理。最后，如果出现日晡潮热，那就是体内有热毒的表现，这时候就需要祛瘀养血来调理了。希望我的分享能帮助大家更好地理解中医，并在日常生活中运用起来。

Translation
Recently, due to the unpredictable weather changes, many friends have experienced symptoms that can be alleviated by eye acupuncture, such as shortness of breath. For instance, I recently met a friend who always feels Qi deficiency, especially during the Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao hours, which are commonly referred to as the twelve Earthly Branches. I recommended he try eye acupuncture and also advised him to pay attention to his diet, avoiding recurrence due to improper diet, as overeating might exacerbate his condition. He also mentioned having fast digestion with rapid hunger, which could be a sign of dysfunction in the spleen and stomach. Additionally, I heard about a condition called Yang syncope, characterized by sudden fainting and cold limbs, requiring prompt adjustment. Lastly, if there is tidal fever in the afternoon, it indicates the presence of heat toxicity within the body, and at this point, one needs to resolve stasis and nourish blood for adjustment. I hope my sharing can help everyone better understand Traditional Chinese Medicine and apply it in their daily lives.
