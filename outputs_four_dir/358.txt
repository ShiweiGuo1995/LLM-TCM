This study aims to explore the correlation between Qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern and Blood stasis due to qi stagnation in clinical manifestations and treatment strategies. Through the analysis of a large number of cases, we found that patients with Qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern often present with symptoms of calming the mind and alleviating palpitations. The dispersive method and pushing-rubbing manipulation are important auxiliary therapeutic methods, showing good effects in relieving the aforementioned symptoms. Further observation reveals that during the transformation from Excess to Deficiency, the application of formulas that astringe the lung and stop coughing and nourishing spleen yin is crucial for improving the overall condition of the patients. This not only helps to alleviate cough symptoms but also enhances their physique, preventing recurrence of the disease. Therefore, the comprehensive use of the above methods has significant value in the treatment of Qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern and Blood stasis due to qi stagnation.
