Translation
In exploring the relationship between biliary ascariasis and subcutaneous fluid retention, we noted that changes in the tongue body are of significant importance for diagnosis. Breast distension/pain during menstruation and allergic rhinitis are also common clinical symptoms, which may be related to dysfunction of internal organs. The occurrence of syncope disorder is often associated with abnormal climate in the year of heavenly complements, indicating that we need to consider the impact of natural environment on diseases during the treatment process. In summary, the interrelations among the above-mentioned diseases deserve further in-depth research.
