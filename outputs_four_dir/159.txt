In exploring the pathogenesis of Shaoyang personality, we notice that phlegm fire blocked the heart spirit pattern is a common manifestation, which is closely related to the stomach fire exuberance pattern. These two patterns often act as cause and effect, forming a complex pathogenesis. In treatment, exterior-releasing methods combined with dampness-resolving and orifice-opening approaches are used to alleviate the symptoms of phlegm fire blocked the heart spirit. For the condition of stomach fire exuberance, strong fire decoction should be applied to enhance the efficacy of the herbs. In Gaohuang, where the lesion is deeply hidden, careful pattern identification and treatment are required. Clinical observations show that through the aforementioned comprehensive therapy, patients' conditions can be effectively improved, and their quality of life can be enhanced.
