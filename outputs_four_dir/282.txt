在夏季炎热之时，人体易感暑湿，出现“血热证”症状，表现为烦躁不安，口干舌燥等，此时宜采用“清暑益气”之法以调和阴阳；若孕期妇女出现肢体浮肿，中医称为“子肿”，多因脾肾功能失调所致，需调理脾胃，温补肾阳；而“寒痰阻肺证”常见于冬季，患者咳嗽痰多色白，治宜温肺化痰；另外，“🗎痹”亦是常见病证，主要表现为关节疼痛，活动受限，治疗上应注重活血化瘀，通络止痛；对于心悸失眠等症状，则可考虑“补心安神”之法，以达到宁心安神的效果。以上所述皆为五脏所主不同病症的治疗原则。

Translation
In the hot summer, the human body is prone to summer dampness, exhibiting symptoms of the "blood heat pattern," characterized by restlessness and dry mouth, etc. At this time, it is advisable to use the method of "clearing summer heat and supplementing qi" to harmonize yin and yang; if pregnant women experience limb edema, it is called "oedema during pregnancy" in Traditional Chinese Medicine, mostly due to dysfunction of the spleen and kidney, requiring regulation and harmonization of the spleen and stomach and warming and tonifying kidney yang; the "cold phlegm obstructing the lung pattern" often occurs in winter, with patients experiencing frequent coughing and white sputum, treatment should focus on warming the lungs and transforming phlegm; furthermore, "fixed impediment" is also a common condition, mainly manifested as joint pain and restricted movement, treatment should emphasize circulating blood and eliminating stasis and unblocking meridians to relieve pain; for symptoms such as palpitations and insomnia, one can consider the method of "nourishing the heart and calming the mind" to achieve the effect of tranquilizing the heart and calming the spirit. The above mentioned are all the treatment principles for different diseases governed by the five zang organs.
