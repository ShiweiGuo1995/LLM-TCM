This article analyzes "release the exterior and purge the interior," "strangury," and "lung heat" conditions, combining clinical practice to explore the diagnosis and treatment of "facial palsy" and "uvula hematoma," and provides suggestions for rehabilitation training for patients with "tendon injuries." Meanwhile, it conducts an in-depth study on the application of the "eight types of people should be declined to learn Taiji" theory during the treatment process, further exploring its guiding significance in the treatment of "postpartum disorders." The research shows that the combination of the "release the exterior and purge the interior" method and the "eight types of people should be declined to learn Taiji" theory has significant therapeutic effects on the above-mentioned conditions.
