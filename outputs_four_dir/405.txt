Translation
In daily life, we often encounter some common health problems, such as emotional disorders, which are usually related to our mental stress and emotional fluctuations. For discomfort caused by dry skin, we can use moistening methods to alleviate it, while also paying attention to the cleaning of dietary intake and avoiding excessive greasy foods. If children develop paediatric smallpox, parents do not need to be overly nervous; this is usually related to seasonal changes, and appropriate adjustments to living habits will suffice. For pregnant women, urine retention in pregnancy and pericoronitis of wisdom tooth are issues that require special attention, and it is recommended to seek medical attention promptly and adopt corresponding treatments for circulating blood and relaxing tendons. Additionally, when there is an abundance of phlegm, improvements can be made through methods to resolve phlegm and open orifices, maintaining the patency of the respiratory tract. In summary, through reasonable dietary adjustments and changes in living habits, many common diseases can be effectively prevented and alleviated.
