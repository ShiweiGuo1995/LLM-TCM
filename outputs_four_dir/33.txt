Translation
Foot acupuncture therapy shows remarkable effects in treating diseases of the stomach, such as gastric pain, especially for symptoms caused by physical overwork. The occurrence of paravertebral abscess and pregnancy swelling is often related to the disharmony of qi and blood within the body; regulating and harmonizing qi and blood can effectively alleviate these conditions. At the same time, when dealing with such diseases, it is necessary to avoid the invasion of pathogenic dampness and maintain the harmony and stability of the internal environment.
