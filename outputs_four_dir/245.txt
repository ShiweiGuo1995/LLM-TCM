Translation
In TCM, the occurrence of dementia is closely related to the obstruction of qi movement. The syndrome of wind-dryness attacking the exterior often leads to disordered qi activity, manifesting as symptoms of regulating qi and transforming phlegm. Furthermore, fluid exhaustion leading to blood dryness exacerbates the condition, causing concurrent patterns, and treatment should employ the warming method to harmonize the qi transformation of the urinary bladder, promoting the circulation of qi and blood within the body, and improving the symptoms of dementia.
