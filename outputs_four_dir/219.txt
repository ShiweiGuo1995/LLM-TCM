Translation
In exploring the relationship between the Qi and Yin deficiency pattern and neck stiffness, we found that using empirical formulas combined with facilitating assistant medicines can achieve good therapeutic effects. Meanwhile, in daily health maintenance, practicing Taijiquan principles not only strengthens the body but also prevents symptoms such as head shaking and neck stiffness caused by insufficient Qi and Yin. For existing diseases like neck stiffness and head shaking, adopting a method to treat both the tip and root can solve the problem of intangible masses at its source, thereby improving the patient's quality of life.
