Translation
In exploring the treatment of the syndrome of qi deficiency of the heart and gallbladder and the syndrome of worry damaging the spleen, we found that using the intradermal needle combined with Shu needling (one of the twelve needling techniques) could effectively regulate the functions of Zang-fu organs, especially showing significant effects in eliminating phlegm and transforming stasis. At the same time, through the collateral-pricking method to assist in clearing heat and opening the orifices, it can better promote the circulation of qi and blood, restoring the balance of the body. It is noteworthy that nurturing innate essence is also a key to preventing such syndromes, requiring attention to conditioning to enhance physical fitness.
