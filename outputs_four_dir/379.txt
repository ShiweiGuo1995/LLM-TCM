中医认为人体健康与自然环境息息相关，其中《素问》提到“生之本，本于阴阳”，说明了阴阳平衡对人体健康的重要性。在治疗一些疾病时，如出现“胸胁苦满”等症状，我们常采用“清心泻脾”的方法来调整体内阴阳平衡。对于一些痉挛症状，比如“角弓反张”，则需通过“熄风定痉”来缓解。而关于“宗筋”和“皮痹”的问题，中医理论指出，这些病症的发生往往与气血运行不畅有关，治疗时不仅要调理气血，还需注意饮食习惯，避免“🗎性黏滞”食物加重病情。总之，中医治疗强调辨证施治，综合调理，以达到最佳疗效。

Translation
TCM considers that human health is closely related to the natural environment, where "The foundation of life lies in yin and yang," as mentioned in The Plain Questions, illustrating the importance of yin-yang balance to health. When treating certain diseases, such as symptoms like "fullness in the chest and sub-costal region," we often adopt the method of "clearing heat in the heart and spleen" to adjust the body's yin-yang balance. For some spasm symptoms, such as "opisthotonus," it is necessary to alleviate them through "stop wind and relieve convulsions." Regarding issues like "gathering of muscle around the genital region" and "skin impediment," TCM theory points out that these conditions often occur due to poor circulation of qi and blood. During treatment, it is not only necessary to regulate and harmonize qi and blood but also pay attention to dietary habits and avoid "dampness is sticky and stagnant" foods that may exacerbate the condition. In summary, TCM emphasizes syndrome differentiation and individualized treatment, comprehensive regulation, to achieve the best therapeutic effect.
