Translation
Patients with the pattern of pathogenic dryness often present with thirst with desire to drink. When treating, it is important to focus on tonifying qi and blood and securing the teeth, with formulas that tonify yin being a commonly selected option. The balance between yin and yang is the foundation of health; however, under disease conditions, such as delirious ravings or heat rash, targeted regulation is required to restore the body's balanced state.
