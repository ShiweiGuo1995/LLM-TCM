Translation
When discussing the treatment of urine retention in pregnancy with formulas of Chinese Medicine, it is particularly important to focus on the pattern of overthinking damaging the spleen qi, which often accompanies tongue manifestations such as peeled tongue. Meanwhile, for the treatment of inflammatory infection of the testis and epididymis, combining cauterized needling therapy and concurrent meridian pattern theory, from the perspective of keeping the coccyx upright, can further enhance clinical efficacy. Studies have shown that the comprehensive application of the above theories and techniques is of great significance for improving patient symptoms and prognosis.
