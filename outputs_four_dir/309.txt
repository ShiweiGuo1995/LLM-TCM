最近有朋友问我关于皮肤上的小疙瘩，也就是我们常说的疣目，这在中医看来往往和体内湿热有关。我通常建议他们从调理脾胃开始，同时结合一些外部治疗，比如使用捋法按摩局部促进气血流通。当然，如果伴有便秘问题，那么滋阴通下的方法就显得尤为重要了。而针对那些长期存在的顽痹，需要通过清热法来改善肝胃气滞证的情况，这样才能从根本上解决问题。另外，如果舌苔呈现霉酱苔的状态，那说明体内的湿气较重，这时候就需要调整饮食习惯，少吃油腻和甜食，多吃蔬菜水果，帮助身体恢复平衡。

Recently, a friend asked me about small lumps on the skin, which we commonly refer to as warts (yóumù). In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), these are often associated with internal damp-heat. I usually recommend they start by regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach (tiáolǐ píwèi), while also combining some external treatments, such as using smoothing manipulation (lǚfǎ) massage to promote the circulation of qi and blood. Of course, if there is a problem with constipation (bìnmì), then the method of nourishing and supplementing yin fluids and promoting bowel movements (zīyīn tōngxià) becomes particularly important. As for those long-standing intractable impediments (wánbì), it is necessary to improve the pattern of liver qi affecting the stomach (gānwèi qìzhì zhèng) through heat-clearing methods (qīngrè fǎ). Only in this way can we address the root cause of the problem. Additionally, if the tongue coating presents as a moulding soymilk coating (méijiàngtái), it indicates that there is a significant amount of dampness in the body. At this point, it is necessary to adjust dietary habits, eat less greasy and sweet foods, and consume more vegetables and fruits to help the body restore balance.
