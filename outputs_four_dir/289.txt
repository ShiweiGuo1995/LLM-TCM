Recently, with the weather turning cooler, many people are experiencing stomach yin deficiency pattern due to cold tending to impair yang, leading to discomfort in the stomach. In daily life, we should focus on regulation; for instance, when doing gentle exercises like Taijiquan, remember to keep the fist vertical to help alleviate impaired qi movement. In terms of diet, one can appropriately consume formulas that tonify yin, such as lily and lotus seed soup, to supplement fire to cultivate earth and strengthen the body. Of course, if sudden severe chest pain occurs, it might be a symptom of sudden cardiac pain, and timely medical attention must be sought to avoid delaying the condition. Through these tips, I hope everyone can maintain health and stay away from the troubles of disease.
