在探讨寒滞胃肠证与寒困脾证的区别时，我们注意到两者虽均表现为脾胃功能减弱的症状，但前者更多见于胃肠道的冷痛和消化不良，后者则主要体现在四肢不温及大便稀溏。对于绦虫病的治疗，除了使用药物祛风杀虫外，还可结合脊背针疗法增强疗效。在诊断过程中，观察小儿食指络脉的震颤法和颜色变化能为疾病提供重要线索，而洪脉则可能提示体内有热或邪气旺盛的情况。综上所述，通过综合运用多种诊断与治疗方法，可以更全面地应对上述病症。

Translation
When discussing the differences between Cold retention in the stomach and intestines pattern and Cold困脾证, we notice that although both patterns manifest as symptoms of weakened spleen and stomach functions, the former is more commonly associated with cold pain and indigestion in the gastrointestinal tract, while the latter primarily presents with cold limbs and loose stools. For the treatment of Taeniasis, in addition to using drugs such as Eliminate wind and kill parasitic worms, back acupuncture can be combined to enhance efficacy. During the diagnosis process, observing the tremor and color changes of the collaterals in the index finger of children can provide important clues for the disease, while a Surging pulse may indicate the presence of heat or vigorous pathogenic qi within the body. In summary, by comprehensively applying various diagnostic and therapeutic methods, we can more fully address the aforementioned conditions.
