最近在诊疗过程中遇到一位患者，他总是感觉颈部僵硬不适，这在中医中称为“项痹”。他的孩子也有点小问题，经常喜欢吃一些奇怪的东西，比如泥土和纸张，这种情况在中医中被称为“小儿异食”。此外，他还提到自己的胃部总是感觉有股热气上涌，甚至出现胃热气逆证的症状，导致食欲不振，我建议他可以试试行气健胃的方法调理。这位患者的妻子则说她每次来月经前后都会有一些身体上的不适，这在中医中属于“经行前后诸证”。最后，我还发现他手臂上有些小小的红肿，中医称之为“疖肿”，这些都是需要我们关注的健康信号。通过调整饮食习惯和生活方式，我相信这些问题都可以得到改善。

Recently, in the course of diagnosis and treatment, I encountered a patient who always felt stiffness and discomfort in his neck. This condition is referred to as "Xiang Bi" in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). His child also had some issues, often eating strange things like soil and paper, which is known as "Paediatric Parorexia" in TCM. Additionally, he mentioned that there was a sensation of heat rising from his stomach, even experiencing symptoms of the "Heat-induced ascending of stomach Qi pattern," leading to poor appetite. I suggested he try regulating with Qi-moving and stomach-strengthening methods. His wife mentioned that she experiences bodily discomfort before and after menstruation, which falls under the category of "Perimenstrual Disorders" in TCM. Lastly, I noticed some small red swellings on his arm, known as "Jie Zhong" in TCM, which are health signals we need to pay attention to. By adjusting dietary habits and lifestyle, I believe these issues can be improved.
