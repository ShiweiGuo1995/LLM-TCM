Translation
In exploring the method of clearing heat and eliminating stagnation for treating the pattern of exuberant heat in the lung and stomach, we found its significant clinical effects. This study observed symptoms such as oral erosion and shivering in patients, combined with the theory that wind is the spearhead of a hundred diseases, and deeply analyzed the intrinsic connection between Yang depletion pattern and the kidney governing storing and sealing. In selecting acupoints, the application of Ashi points played a crucial role in alleviating the aforementioned symptoms. Additionally, this study noted that patients with different patterns exhibit individual differences in their response to treatment methods, which suggests that in clinical practice, we need to pay more attention to pattern differentiation and tailored treatment to improve therapeutic efficacy.
