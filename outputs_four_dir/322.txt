最近有位朋友向我诉苦，说她怀孕后总是感到恶心呕吐，特别是早上更为严重，这在中医里叫妊娠呕吐。我建议她可以试试辛温开窍的方法，通过一些温和的食疗来缓解症状。另外，她的孩子最近也出现了食欲不振和体重下降的情况，这可能是疳积的表现。我建议她带孩子去看医生，看看是不是需要清泄里热。同时，她还提到自己有时候会感觉口中有酸味，这可能是因为体内寒热真假混淆导致的。为了更好地了解她的体质，我还为她把了脉，发现她的尺脉有些异常。最后，她还担心家里老人的咽喉不适，怀疑是咽喉菌感染。希望我的一些建议能帮到他们。

Translation
Recently, a friend complained to me that she often felt nauseous and vomited after becoming pregnant, especially in the morning. This condition is known in Traditional Chinese Medicine as pregnancy vomiting. I suggested she could try the method of dissipating cold and opening the orifices, using some gentle dietary therapy to alleviate the symptoms. Additionally, her child has recently shown a lack of appetite and weight loss, which may be indicative of mild malnutrition with food stagnation. I recommended that she take the child to see a doctor to determine if there is a need for clearing and reducing interior heat. At the same time, she mentioned that sometimes she feels a sour flavor in her mouth, which might be due to the confusion between true and false internal cold and heat. To better understand her constitution, I took her pulse and found that her chi pulsation was somewhat abnormal. Finally, she was also concerned about the throat discomfort of an elderly family member, suspecting it might be throat cancer. I hope my suggestions can help them.
