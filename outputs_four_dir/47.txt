Translation
This article aims to explore the correlation between male genital disorders and the method of clearing heat, drying dampness, and detoxifying. Through clinical observation, it was found that patients with such diseases often exhibit symptoms of unconsciousness and bound pulse. During treatment, abdominal acupuncture therapy is combined with the method of clearing qi and cooling blood. At the same time, Tuina is used to promote the circulation of qi and blood. For cases where the causative factors are clearly identified as external etiological factors, both internal and external treatments must be emphasized to achieve satisfactory therapeutic effects.
