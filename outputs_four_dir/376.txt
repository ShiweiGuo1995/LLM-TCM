Translation
The pattern of disharmony between the heart and kidney with insufficiency of yin fluids and the pattern of excess heat in the heart and liver often lead to pain below the heart and cold hands and feet, while the pattern of exuberant heat consuming fluids and the pattern of dryness invading the lung are commonly associated with dysfunction of the Lung storing the Corporeal Soul (Po), presenting symptoms such as dry mouth and tongue. For the aforementioned symptoms, astringent formulas can be selected to harmonize the Yin-Yang and balance the internal environment.
