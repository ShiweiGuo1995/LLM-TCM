Original Text
在探讨中医治疗原则时，我们常常提到“滋阴益气”与“滋阴润燥剂”的重要性，这两种方法常用于改善因阴虚导致的“口干”症状。此外，“敛汗固表”是治疗外感病的重要策略之一，有助于防止病邪侵入体内。对于皮肤疾病如疮疡，“提脓祛腐”则是不可或缺的治疗方法。然而，在某些特殊情况下，患者可能会出现“吐舌”的症状，这可能是由于体内湿热过重所致。在妇科领域，“子肿”是孕期常见病症，需通过调理气血来缓解。最后，“痹证”是指由风寒湿等外邪引起的关节疼痛，采用适当的中药方剂可以有效缓解。

Translation
In discussing the principles of TCM treatment, we often emphasize the importance of "tonifying qi and nourishing yin" and "nourish yin and moisten dryness formulas," both of which are commonly used to improve symptoms of "dry mouth" caused by yin deficiency. Additionally, "astringe sweating and secure the exterior" is one of the important strategies for treating exogenous diseases, helping to prevent the invasion of pathogenic factors into the body. For skin diseases such as boils, "draw pus and eliminate putridity" is an indispensable treatment method. However, in certain special cases, patients may exhibit the symptom of "protruding tongue," which could be due to excessive internal damp-heat. In the field of gynecology, "oedema during pregnancy" is a common condition during pregnancy, which needs to be alleviated by regulating and harmonizing qi and blood. Finally, "Bi-impediment disorders" refer to joint pain caused by external pathogens such as wind, cold, and dampness; appropriate Chinese medicine prescriptions can effectively alleviate these conditions.
