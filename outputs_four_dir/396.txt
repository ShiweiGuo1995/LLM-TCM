Translation
In TCM, the kidney governs the bones; for symptoms such as insensitivity of the skin and paralyzed tongue, we can improve them through point injection. Additionally, the lung's function in governing breathing has a close relationship with skin health; diseases such as heat rash and goiter are often associated with dysfunction of the lung. In treating astringe essence and stop seminal emissions, TCM has unique insights and methods, and comprehensive regulation can achieve excellent therapeutic effects.
