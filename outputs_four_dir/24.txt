在探讨妇科疾病时，我们常遇到淡紫舌等表现，提示胞宫阳虚证的存在。此类患者常伴有腹水，治疗上需重视补气固脱，调理气郁痰凝证。夜间梦交亦为其常见症状之一，此与体内阴阳失衡有关。此外，燥邪伤肺证亦可能伴随出现，需综合调理后阴，以达到调和阴阳，恢复健康之效。

Translation
In discussing gynecological diseases, we often encounter manifestations such as pale purple tongue, indicating the existence of uterine yang deficiency pattern. Such patients frequently suffer from ascites, and treatment should focus on tonifying qi to prevent collapse and regulating qi stagnation with phlegm retention pattern. Nocturnal sleep sex is also a common symptom, which is related to the imbalance of yin and yang within the body. Additionally, dryness invading the lung pattern may accompany this condition, and it is necessary to comprehensively regulate posterior yin to achieve harmony between yin and yang and restore health.
