女性宫颈癌的发生与高危型人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染关系密切，及时有效地阻断高危型 HPV 感染对预防宫颈癌的发生有重要意义。黄元御的“一气周流”理论思想崇尚中土，注重整体气机的调畅，可阐释女性的生理病理。而高危型 HPV 感染的发生与中焦脾土失运，气机周流不畅，机体抗邪能力低下致清浊升降失常有关。基于“一气周流”理论结合“治未病”思想，笔者提出“未病先防，调畅中土存正气”“既病防变，升降相因祛毒邪”“瘥后防复，阴阳平衡和气血”的高危型 HPV 感染的防治原则，以期为临床治疗提供参考。||The occurrence of cervical cancer in women is closely related to the infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Timely and effective blocking of high-risk HPV infection is of great significance in preventing the occurrence of cervical cancer. Huang Yuanyu's theory of "One Qi Circulation" advocates the importance of the Middle Earth and focuses on the smooth regulation of overall Qi movement, which can elucidate the physiological and pathological aspects of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is associated with the dysfunction of the Middle jiao Spleen Earth, the obstruction of Qi movement circulation, and the low resistance of the body leading to the abnormal ascent and descent of clear and turbid substances. Based on the "One Qi Circulation" theory combined with the concept of "Preventing a disease before it arises," the author proposes the prevention and treatment principles for high-risk HPV infection: "Preventing a disease before it arises, regulating and smoothing the Middle Earth to preserve Healthy qi," "Preventing transmission of a disease after its onset, ensuring the mutual coordination of ascent and descent to expel Toxic pathogens," and "Preventing recurrence after recovery, balancing Yin–yang and harmonizing Qi and Blood," aiming to provide a reference for clinical treatment.

The pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) involves the deficiency of Heart qi and Heart yang, and prolonged dysfunction of Sanjiao qi transformation, progressing from deficiency to excess in the later stages, manifesting as combined deficiency and excess. The Poria, Cinnamon Twig, Atractylodes, and Licorice Decoction (abbreviated as "Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang") functions through the "Four-in-One" approach: its nature is acrid, sweet, and warm, with a blend of bland, sweet, and bitter flavors, where acrid, sweet, and warm flavors promote qi transformation, diuresis, support yang, and expel retained fluids, while the bland and bitter flavors permeate water, dry dampness, and unblock water passages; its location targets the Heart, Spleen, and Sanjiao, invigorating Heart yang, strengthening the Spleen to expel retained fluids, and regulating the Sanjiao water passages; its momentum involves simultaneous action in the upper and lower, internal and external, unblocking the upper and benefiting the lower, and dispersing externally while supplementing internally, thus facilitating the smooth passage of Sanjiao water channels; its pattern addresses the deficiency of Heart yang and the泛滥 of water and phlegm-fluid retention, commonly used in treating heart diseases characterized by upward surging of water qi. The dysfunction of Sanjiao and the recurrent episodes of CHF are mutually causative; Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang warms the fire of Sanjiao qi transformation and unblocks the pathways of Sanjiao qi transformation, effectively addressing the systemic fluid retention in CHF. Its pharmacological actions include anti-inflammatory effects, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of myocardial cell membrane ion channels, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, and regulation of vascular constriction and dilation. Decomposing Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang from the "Four-in-One" perspective and exploring its mechanism in treating CHF through the theory of "Sanjiao qi transformation" holds significant importance for revitalizing the vitality of classical formulas and their precise and effective application.

尿毒症瘙痒（UP）是终末期肾脏病患者常见并发症，严重降低患者生活质量。中医外治法治疗 UP 相较于中药内治法操作简便、起效迅速，且能避免口服药物所致首关效应及可能带来肝肾损伤，治疗手段主要包括中药外洗、药浴、熏洗、湿敷、灌肠、刮痧、针刺、耳穴贴压、穴位敷贴、穴位离子导入、自体血穴位注射等。目前，多数研究在西医常规治疗基础上加用中医外治法，可提高疗效，在改善瘙痒症状、炎症指标、睡眠质量及焦虑抑郁状态等方面具有一定优势；一些研究选取甲状旁腺激素、血磷、CRP、IL-6、组胺、SCr、BUN、β2-微球蛋白等指标评价疗效，结果提示中医外治法可改善患者微炎症状态，保护肾功能，但其作用机制有待进一步研究。现有研究存在以下问题：临床疗效评价量表不统一，难以横向比较和总结；瘙痒症状的缓解依据量表评判，主观性较强；研究疗程较短，无法评判远期疗效和安全性；部分研究未指明患者证型，难以体现中医辨证论治优势等，今后还需完善。||Uremic pruritus (UP) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, significantly reducing their quality of life. External treatment methods in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for UP are simpler to operate and quicker to take effect compared to internal treatment with Chinese herbal medicines, and they can avoid the first-pass effect of oral medications and potential liver and kidney damage. The main treatment methods include external washing with Chinese herbal medicines, medicinal baths, fumigation and washing, wet compresses, enemas, scraping, acupuncture, ear point pressing, acupoint application, acupoint iontophoresis, and autologous blood point injection. Currently, most studies add TCM external treatments to conventional Western medical treatments, which can enhance efficacy and have certain advantages in improving pruritus symptoms, inflammatory markers, sleep quality, and anxiety and depression states. Some studies select indicators such as parathyroid hormone, blood phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, and β2-microglobulin to evaluate efficacy, suggesting that TCM external treatments can improve patients' micro-inflammatory state and protect renal function, but their mechanism of action requires further research. Existing studies have the following issues: the clinical efficacy evaluation scales are not unified, making it difficult to compare and summarize horizontally; the relief of pruritus symptoms is based on scale assessment, which is highly subjective; the study duration is short, unable to judge long-term efficacy and safety; some studies do not specify the patients' pattern types, making it difficult to reflect the advantages of TCM treatment based on pattern identification. These issues need to be addressed in future research.

通过挖掘醒脑开窍理论的核心思想，分析醒脑开窍理论与中医脑病的关系，探究针灸辨治中医脑病的必要性，以明晰针灸脑病当如何辨证论治。“醒脑开窍”是调神理论的核心，是立足于醒脑、醒神、调神的原则而确立，其调神思想与中医脑病证治密不可分。基于针灸疗法的特色及中医脑病的复杂性和特殊性，针灸治疗脑病理应有其独特的辨证论治体系。针灸实践过程中，中医脑病证治当以“脑”为本，以“醒神调神”为总治则，在“醒脑开窍针法”主穴基础上化裁，针对不同脑病配合相应的治法。||By delving into the core concepts of the theory of "awakening the brain and opening the orifices," analyzing the relationship between this theory and TCM encephalic diseases, and exploring the necessity of acupuncture and moxibustion in the differentiation and treatment of TCM encephalic diseases, we aim to clarify how to apply syndrome differentiation and treatment in acupuncture for brain diseases. "Awakening the brain and opening the orifices" is the core of the theory of regulating the spirit, established based on the principles of awakening the brain, awakening the spirit, and regulating the spirit. Its concept of regulating the spirit is closely intertwined with the syndrome treatment of TCM encephalic diseases. Given the unique features of acupuncture therapy and the complexity and particularity of TCM encephalic diseases, acupuncture treatment for brain diseases should have its distinct system of treatment based on pattern identification. In the practice of acupuncture, the treatment of TCM encephalic diseases should take the "brain" as the foundation, with "awakening and regulating the spirit" as the overarching principle, and modify the main points of the "awakening the brain and opening the orifices acupuncture method" accordingly, complementing different brain diseases with corresponding treatment methods.

糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）为糖尿病常见慢性并发症，可导致足部溃疡、坏疽，严重者可导致截肢，影响患者生活质量。DPN属中医“痹病”“痿病”等范畴，主要病机为气血阴阳亏虚，痰浊瘀血痹阻脉络，临床以气虚血瘀证多见。本文基于《黄帝内经》“气脉常通”理论，提出DPN气虚血瘀证患者的治疗应以“益气活血、化瘀通痹”为原则，使患者气脉通达，延缓疾病进展，为DPN的中医治疗提供参考。||Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes, which can lead to foot ulcers and gangrene, and in severe cases, may result in amputation, affecting the quality of life of patients. DPN falls under the categories of "Bi-impediment disorders" and "Flaccidity disorders" in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with the main pathogenesis being the deficiency of Qi, Blood, Yin, and Yang, as well as the obstruction of meridians by phlegm and static blood, with Qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern being frequently observed clinically. Based on the theory of "constant flow of Qi and vessels" from the "Huangdi Neijing," this article proposes that the treatment of DPN patients with Qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern should adhere to the principles of "tonifying Qi, activating Blood, resolving stasis, and unblocking impediment," to ensure the free flow of Qi and vessels in patients, thereby delaying the progression of the disease, providing a reference for the TCM treatment of DPN.

The core pathogenesis is the dysfunction of Qi and Blood, impairment of the Heart Spirit, and disorder of ascending and descending, leading to the stagnation of the pivot. The treatment should harmonize the ascending and descending of Qi and Blood, focusing on tonifying Qi and activating Blood, as well as regulating the ascending and descending. Among these, tonifying Qi takes precedence in the treatment of Qi and Blood, and appropriate Blood-activating herbs should be selected based on the degree of Blood stasis to ensure the smooth flow of Blood Vessels and provide support for the Spirit. The regulation of ascending and descending should emphasize the adjustment of the liver's ascending, lung's descending, and the functions of the spleen and stomach, paying attention to the properties of ascending, descending, floating, and sinking of the herbs, in accordance with the physiological functions of the Zang-fu organs, to restore the normal Qi movement of the Zang-fu organs.

雷公藤广泛应用于自身免疫系统疾病的治疗，但其明显的生殖毒性使其临床应用及推广受到限制。目前针对雷公藤的生殖损伤，尚未有明确的解决方案。中医认为，雷公藤的生殖毒性当责之于其辛苦寒凉之性，久用可燥肝血、伤肝阳、耗肾精、损肾阳，破坏脏腑的气血阴阳平衡，致不孕不育。本文根据肝肾与人体生殖功能的联系，提出从“乙癸同源”角度认识雷公藤的生殖毒性，并依据“肝肾同治”思想探索雷公藤生殖毒性的减毒之法，以期为临床安全应用拓展中医理论思考。||Tripterygium wilfordii is widely used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, but its significant reproductive toxicity limits its clinical application and promotion. Currently, there is no clear solution for the reproductive damage caused by Tripterygium wilfordii. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) holds that the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii is attributed to its bitter, pungent, and cold-natured properties. Prolonged use can dry Liver blood, injure Liver yang, consume Kidney essence, and damage Kidney yang, disrupting the balance of Qi, Blood, Yin, and Yang in the Zang–fu organs, leading to infertility. This article, based on the connection between the liver and kidney and human reproductive function, proposes understanding the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii from the perspective of "Yi (liver) and Gui (kidney) share the same source," and explores methods to reduce its reproductive toxicity according to the concept of "simultaneous treatment of the liver and kidney," aiming to expand TCM theoretical thinking for safe clinical application.

Methods: Clinical research literature on TCM treatment of SAP was retrieved from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP Database, and SinoMed up to February 28, 2022. Software including Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, and SPSS Statistics 22.0 were used for frequency statistics, cluster analysis, and association rule analysis of Chinese herbal medicines data to summarize the core prescriptions. Results: A total of 289 prescriptions were included, involving 185 Chinese herbal medicines and 38 TCM patterns. Based on the holistic study of SAP as a "disease," the clinical treatment of SAP primarily involves blood-circulating and stasis-transforming medicines, tonic medicines for deficiency and vital Qi, and Qi-regulating and phlegm-transforming medicines. Frequently used herbs include Chuanxiong, Danshen, Gancao, Huangqi, and Danggui; common herb pairs include Chuanxiong-Danggui, Chuanxiong-Honghua, and Chuanxiong-Zhishi. Drug complex network diagrams and cluster analysis show that the modified Buyang Huanwu Tang is the basic prescription for treating SAP. Based on the study of SAP "patterns," Qi deficiency and blood stasis pattern, intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern, and Qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern are common TCM patterns in SAP, with medication primarily focusing on warm and neutral properties; the flavors mainly include sweet, pungent, and bitter, predominantly attributing to the liver, spleen, lung, and heart meridians. Specifically, the Qi deficiency and blood stasis pattern is treated with Buyang Huanwu Tang, which includes high-frequency herbs such as Huangqi, Chuanxiong, and Danshen; the intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern is commonly treated with the combination of Gualou Xiebai Banxia Tang and Taohong Siwu Tang, which includes high-frequency herbs such as prepared Banxia, Chuanxiong, and Xiebai; the Qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern is treated with Xuefu Zhuyu Tang, which includes high-frequency herbs such as Chuanxiong, Danggui, and Zhike. Cluster analysis of the herbs for Qi deficiency and blood stasis pattern and Qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern can be divided into 3 categories, while the intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern can be divided into 4 categories. Conclusion: Deficiency, stasis, phlegm, and stagnation are important pathological factors in SAP, with Qi deficiency as the basis for onset and blood stasis persisting throughout the disease, possibly accompanied by phlegm turbidity and Qi stagnation. Focusing on the pathogenesis of root deficiency and branch excess, clinical treatment often involves tonic medicines and blood-circulating and stasis-transforming medicines, selected based on pattern differentiation.

基于络病理论，认为邪侵肺络，癌毒内蕴，逐渐形成“瘀络”“盛络”“虚络”等络脉病变，与肿瘤细胞形成的异常血管网络较为相似，可分别演变为缺氧、炎症、免疫抑制性的肿瘤微环境，影响肺癌的治疗效果。结合肿瘤生物学特性，基于叶天士“络以通为用”观点，可相应运用化瘀通络、解毒通络、益气通络之法，活用化瘀、解毒与扶正药物，靶向调节缺氧环境、炎症状态和免疫反应，有助于诱导肿瘤血管正常化，重塑肿瘤微环境，在提高联合治疗疗效的同时，也可减轻不良反应、提高患者耐受性。||Based on the theory of collateral disease, it is believed that pathogenic factors invade the lung collaterals and cancer toxins accumulate internally, gradually leading to collateral pathological changes such as "stasis collaterals," "exuberant collaterals," and "deficient collaterals," which are similar to the abnormal vascular network formed by tumor cells. These changes can evolve into hypoxic, inflammatory, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, affecting the treatment efficacy of lung cancer. By integrating the biological characteristics of tumors and following Ye Tian Shi's principle that "collaterals should be unblocked to function properly," corresponding methods such as transforming stasis and unblocking collaterals, detoxifying and unblocking collaterals, and tonifying qi and unblocking collaterals can be applied. The flexible use of drugs for transforming stasis, detoxification, and supporting anti-pathogenic qi can target and regulate hypoxic environments, inflammatory states, and immune responses, thereby aiding in the induction of tumor vascular normalization and重塑肿瘤微环境. This approach not only enhances the efficacy of combined therapies but also reduces adverse reactions and improves patient tolerance.

中风软瘫以中风后患者身体运动功能异常，肌肉张力下降为主要表现，是中风后较为常见的病理状态，软瘫时间越长预后越差。中医理论认为，中风主因“虚、风、火、痰、瘀、气”而发病，当邪气搏结、阻于经络则使气血凝滞、经筋损伤、肌肉痿废，导致中风软瘫，因此需立以通经柔筋为其主要治法。火针治疗中风软瘫具有通经温阳、柔筋止痛的作用，可温阳散寒、充养经脉经气、松解筋脉结节、推动气血运行、濡养四肢百骸。火针疗法可促进神经通路的恢复，加强局部新陈代谢，改善局部肌张力，从而恢复肢体功能。火针治疗中风后软瘫的高质量临床研究、选穴规律、规范化操作手法等有待进一步深化。||Flaccid paralysis after wind stroke is characterized by abnormal motor function and decreased muscle tone in patients following a stroke, representing a common pathological state post-stroke, with longer duration of flaccid paralysis correlating with poorer prognosis. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, wind stroke is primarily caused by "Deficiency, Wind, Fire, Phlegm, Stasis, and Qi" factors. When pathogenic Qi congests and obstructs the meridians and collaterals, it leads to stagnation of Qi and Blood, damage to the twelve muscle regions, and muscle flaccidity, resulting in flaccid paralysis after wind stroke. Therefore, the main treatment principle is to unblock the meridians and soften the sinews. Fire needling therapy for flaccid paralysis after wind stroke functions to unblock meridians, warm Yang, soften sinews, and alleviate pain. It can warm Yang and dissipate cold, nourish the Qi of meridians, loosen nodules in the sinews, promote the circulation of Qi and Blood, and nourish the limbs and bones. Fire needling can facilitate the recovery of neural pathways, enhance local metabolism, improve local muscle tone, thereby restoring limb function. High-quality clinical research on fire needling for post-stroke flaccid paralysis, selection of acupoints, and standardized operational techniques await further exploration.

By tracing back to the original academic thoughts of Liu Wansu, it can be understood that Fangfeng Tongsheng San should treat wind as the tip and heat as the root, adopting the principle of treating both the tip and root simultaneously, and resolving both the exterior and interior. It is designed for diseases characterized by predominant fire-heat and both external and internal excess patterns. In recent years, domestic research on this formula has mainly focused on dermatological diseases, endocrine and metabolic diseases, digestive system diseases, and respiratory system diseases, while international research has concentrated on obesity-related metabolic disorders. Studies have found that Fangfeng Tongsheng San has anti-allergic, immune-regulating, and metabolic disorder-improving effects. Currently, fundamental research on Fangfeng Tongsheng San in China is relatively insufficient, and further in-depth exploration of its mechanism is needed, along with the initiation of more large-sample, high-quality RCTs.

By inheriting and innovating Mr. Pu Fuzhou's academic thought of "smoothing Qi and Blood, emphasizing ascending and descending," as well as the "harmony and integration" philosophy of National Medical Master Xue Boshi, treatment should start from the essence of dual-heart dysfunction, with "simultaneous regulation of Qi and Blood, ascending clear and descending turbid" as the core therapeutic method. Among these, the simultaneous regulation of Qi and Blood should differentiate treatment based on Deficiency and Excess; if Deficiency is predominant, the combination of Taiji functions should be used to regulate and supplement Qi and Blood, commonly using Shuanghe Powder; if Excess is predominant, the integration of stillness in movement should be applied to smooth the blood vessels, commonly using Huangqi Chifeng Decoction and Yueju Pills. Ascending clear and descending turbid should involve the regulation of Qi movement and appropriate combination of tonification and purgation, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate Qi and relieve depression, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to tonify Qi and ascend clear, and Zhizhu Decoction and Zhizhu Pills to expel turbidity and eliminate filth.

It is believed that factors like dietary irregularities and emotional distress lead to spleen deficiency and dampness accumulation, and the intertwining of various pathogenic factors forms tangible foreign bodies, which is the TCM pathogenesis of dampness evil causing colorectal polyps. Based on the pathogenic characteristics of dampness evil, combined with the factors contributing to the onset of colorectal polyps, this discussion explores the influence of dampness evil in the pathogenesis of colorectal polyps, aiming to provide an effective TCM theoretical basis for the integrated Chinese and Western medical diagnosis and treatment of colorectal polyps in clinical practice.

五善七恶是一种判断中医外科疾病预后的理论，被诸多中医古籍提及，为历代外科医家重视，但现代文献对其论述较少。五善七恶首见于《太平圣惠方》，其理论源自《灵枢·玉版》中的“逆顺”。五善七恶经过历代医家的发挥，衍生出诸多变体。通过梳理历代医籍对五善七恶的记载，发现主要版本有两大类：一是《太平圣惠方》版及其衍生版（痘疹五善七恶、五善七恶救援法等）；二是《外科正宗》版及其衍生版。||The theory of "Five Goods and Seven Evils" is a method for judging the prognosis of surgical diseases in traditional Chinese medicine, mentioned in numerous ancient TCM texts and valued by generations of surgical practitioners, yet it is less discussed in modern literature. The concept of "Five Goods and Seven Evils" first appeared in the "Taiping Shenghui Fang," with its theoretical origins traced back to the "Lingshu·Yuban" section on "Reversal and Compliance." Through the elaborations of various medical scholars over the dynasties, numerous variants of the "Five Goods and Seven Evils" have emerged. By reviewing the records of this theory in historical medical texts, it is found that there are mainly two major versions: one being the "Taiping Shenghui Fang" version and its derivatives (such as the "Five Goods and Seven Evils of Smallpox," "Rescue Methods for Five Goods and Seven Evils," etc.); the other being the "Waike Zhengzong" version and its derivatives.

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。||A systematic review of Longdan Xiegan Tang in various medical texts throughout the ages reveals that the initial version recorded in "Lan Shi Mi Cang" primarily targeted male anterior yin malodorous diseases. Through Xue Ji's modifications, the scope of its indications gradually broadened, leading to confusion in the formula's name, composition, and origins, with "Jing Yue Quan Shu" and "Yi Fang Ji Jie" being particularly prominent in this regard. Previous physicians often interpreted this formula from the perspective of Zang-fu organs. However, shifting the perspective to analyze it from the meridian viewpoint may better elucidate the governing principles of Longdan Xiegan Tang. Classifying anterior yin disorders under the liver meridian of foot-Jueyin and attributing symptoms like pain in the subcostal region and deafness to the gallbladder meridian of foot-Shaoyang, along with adjusting the medication based on the condition, not only facilitates a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the formula to achieve precise pattern identification and medication in clinical practice but also prompts modern researchers to reconsider the crucial role of the theory of meridians and collaterals in the formation and development of the entire Traditional Chinese Medicine theoretical system.

《本草纲目》作为明代代表性本草著作，书中所附植物图像以另一种形式保留了李时珍对药材基原植物的考证结果，真实反映了明代对药物与植物的认识与利用情况。以书中木部香木类植物图像为例，通过考证图像所绘植物基原，以揭示明代对植物知识与药物性质的认识水平。木部香木类所载的 25 幅图像中，20 幅图像准确描述了植物的叶花及果实等，杉图对植物三尖杉形态细节的表述等均证明了明代对植物形态与药物性质认识处于较高水平。但乌药、阿魏等共 5 图的错误也说明明代对植物形态的认识仍有局限之处。通过图像考证结果与文字所载药性对比可知，明代对药性的了解程度已然鞭辟着里，对部分植物的药性认识甚至高于对其形态的了解。||"Compendium of Materia Medica," as a representative work of Materia medica during the Ming Dynasty, preserves Li Shizhen's research results on the original plants of medicinal materials in the form of appended plant illustrations, truly reflecting the understanding and utilization of drugs and plants in the Ming Dynasty. Taking the images of aromatic wood plants in the Wood Section of the book as an example, by researching the original plants depicted in the illustrations, it reveals the level of understanding of plant knowledge and drug properties in the Ming Dynasty. Among the 25 images recorded in the Wood Section of aromatic wood plants, 20 images accurately describe the leaves, flowers, and fruits of the plants. The detailed depiction of the morphology of Cephalotaxus fortunei in the Fir image, among others, demonstrates that the understanding of plant morphology and drug properties in the Ming Dynasty was at a relatively high level. However, the errors in the 5 images of plants such as Lindera aggregata and Ferula assa-foetida also indicate that there were still limitations in the understanding of plant morphology during the Ming Dynasty. By comparing the research results of the images with the recorded drug properties in the text, it can be seen that the understanding of drug properties in the Ming Dynasty was already profound, and the understanding of the medicinal properties of some plants was even higher than that of their morphology.

通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。||By analyzing relevant unearthed and transmitted texts, this study elucidates the treatment details of "Stony gangrene. The most superior is the treatment by the Stony Spirit, which will surely cure; followed by the treatment of Stony Blood, which will achieve a balanced state; and lastly the treatment of Stony Pus, where one out of eleven cases will survive" from the "Reversal and Compliance of the Five Colours, Vessels, and Examination of Essence and Spirit" in the "Tianhui Medical Bamboo Slips." It elaborates on its connection with the theories of transmitted medical classics. Compared to the Bian-stone needling methods in the "Pulse Techniques" from the Mawangdui tombs and the "Pulse Book" from Zhangjiashan, the "Stony Spirit" method for treating abscess disorders in the "Tianhui Medical Bamboo Slips" is applied before the accumulation of blood and formation of pus in abscesses, which can prevent the progression of the disease and achieve a "sure cure" effect. Additionally, the diagnostic and treatment methods related to stony gangrene may have inspired, to some extent, the later concept of "regulating the spirit" and the theory of preventing a disease before it arises.

《伤寒类证便览》是明新安医家陆彦功编集整理的一部伤寒类医籍，计 12 卷，初刊于明弘治十二年（1499）。国内外现存有 3 种版本：一种为藏于日本内阁文库全本和辽宁中医药大学图书馆藏的残本，两地藏本均为婺源汪范依据陆氏保和堂于明弘治十二年刊本进行缮写翻刻的刻本，刊刻时间不详，原保和堂弘治十二年刊本未见；一种为藏于四川省图书馆的所谓“明弘治刻本”；一种为藏于上海中医药大学图书馆的清代精抄本。其文献来源主要有《伤寒类证》《注解伤寒论》《伤寒明理论》《活人书》《太平惠民和剂局方》《此事难知》《伤寒图歌活人指掌》《胎产药方》《小儿伤寒药方》。该书使已经亡佚的《伤寒类证》得以较完整地流传下来。||"Shang Han Lei Zheng Bian Lan" is a collection of medical texts on exogenous febrile disorders compiled and organized by Lu Yangong, a physician from Xin'an during the Ming Dynasty, consisting of 12 volumes, first published in the twelfth year of the Hongzhi era (1499). There are currently three extant versions both domestically and internationally: one is a complete copy housed in the Japanese Cabinet Library and a fragmentary copy in the Library of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, both of which are block-printed editions transcribed and re-carved by Wang Fan from Wuyuan based on the original edition published by Lu's Baohe Tang in the twelfth year of Hongzhi, with the publication date of these copies being unknown, and the original Baohe Tang edition from the twelfth year of Hongzhi has not been seen; another is the so-called "Ming Hongzhi block-printed edition" preserved in the Sichuan Provincial Library; and the last is a Qing Dynasty fine manuscript copy stored in the Library of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The main sources of its literature include "Shang Han Lei Zheng," "Zhu Jie Shang Han Lun," "Shang Han Ming Li Lun," "Huo Ren Shu," "Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang," "Ci Shi Nan Zhi," "Shang Han Tu Ge Huo Ren Zhi Zhang," "Tai Chan Yao Fang," and "Xiao Er Shang Han Yao Fang." This book has allowed the already lost "Shang Han Lei Zheng" to be transmitted relatively completely.
