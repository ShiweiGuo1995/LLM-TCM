最近有朋友问我关于汗类病的问题，其实这在中医里属于营卫不和证的一种表现，常伴有腻苔和内寒的症状。治疗时可以试试推揉法，配合舒张进针法，同时注意饮食，少吃酸味食物，以免加重肾不纳气证的情况。日常生活中也要注意保暖，避免病情加重。||Recently, a friend asked me about issues related to sweating disorders. Actually, this falls under the category of Disharmony between the Ying-nutrients and Wei-defence pattern in Traditional Chinese Medicine, often accompanied by symptoms such as greasy tongue and Internal cold. During treatment, one can try pushing-kneading manipulation, combined with skin-stretching insertion technique, while also paying attention to diet, reducing intake of sour-flavored foods to avoid exacerbating the Kidney failing to absorb qi pattern. In daily life, it's important to keep warm to prevent the condition from worsening.

中医认为梦魇多与心肺阴虚证有关，常表现为少神、五运六气失衡时症状加重。观察舌象，若见腐苔，则更需注意调理脾胃，因脾在志为思，过思则伤脾，导致气臌等症。临床上，针对此类病症，可用验方进行调治，以达到阴阳平衡的状态。||In TCM, nightmares are mostly related to the pattern of yin deficiency of the heart and lung. They often manifest as insufficiency of spirit and symptoms worsen when the five movements and six qi are out of balance. Observing tongue manifestations, if curdy coating is seen, it is necessary to pay more attention to regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach. This is because the emotion of the spleen is overthinking; excessive thinking injures the spleen, leading to qi tympanites and other symptoms. Clinically, for such conditions, empirical formulas can be used for adjustment and treatment to achieve a state of yin-yang balance.

在中医治疗中，我们讲究分经论治，针对不同的病症采用不同的治疗方法。比如牛皮癣，这是一种常见的皮肤病，而侠瘿瘤则是一种颈部肿瘤。在治疗过程中，我们还需注意胞宫热证，避免病情加重。行针是中医常用的治疗方法之一，通过刺激穴位来调整身体机能。对于脾虚生风证和五志化火的情况，我们也需要采取相应的调理措施。当然，在日常生活中，我们也要注意饮食习惯，避免食用过于辛辣的食物，以免引发石蛾等不适症状。||In TCM treatment, we emphasize the principle of formulating prescriptions based on meridian differentiation, adopting different therapeutic methods for different diseases. For instance, collar sore is a common skin disease, while hyperparathyroidism is a type of neck tumor. During the treatment process, we also need to pay attention to heat patterns in the uterine region to avoid aggravating the condition. Needling manipulation is one of the commonly used TCM treatment methods, which adjusts bodily functions by stimulating acupoints. For spleen deficiency generating wind pattern and five emotions transforming into fire, we also need to take corresponding adjustment measures. Of course, in daily life, we should also pay attention to dietary habits and avoid eating excessively spicy foods to prevent symptoms such as stony tonsillitis.

在中医理论中，梦魇与伤食常被认为是脾胃功能失调所致。临床观察到患者出现大脉、舌麻痹等症状时，可能需要考虑补益肾气。此外，女性患者若伴有暴泻及固冲止带问题，需警惕野屎风的影响，此病多因气血两虚，湿热内蕴所致，治疗时应注重调理。||In TCM theory, nightmares and food damage are often attributed to dysfunction of the spleen and stomach. Clinically, when patients exhibit symptoms such as a large pulse and tongue paralysis, it may be necessary to consider tonifying kidney qi. Additionally, female patients with symptoms of fulminant diarrhea and issues of securing the Chong meridian and stopping leucorrhea should be cautious of the influence of Ancylostoma dermatitis; this disease is mostly due to dual deficiency of qi and blood, with internal accumulation of damp-heat, and during treatment, attention should be paid to regulation.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友出现了月经过少的情况，这可能是由于体内寒湿过重导致的。中医认为心其华在面，如果面色苍白，可能是因为气血不足。而我最近遇到的一个案例是关于冬温病的，患者起初只是觉得身体发热，却没想到是热证，后来发展成了肠痨，真是令人担忧。治疗时发现，他还有痰蕴脾证的症状，需要调理脾胃，化痰祛湿。另外，还有一位患者因为长期熬夜，导致虚实真假难辨，肺主治节失调，出现了咳嗽不止的现象。这些情况都提醒我们，日常生活中要注意调养身体，保持良好的生活习惯。||Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, many friends have experienced scanty menstruation, which may be due to excessive internal cold and dampness. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, it is believed that the lustre of the heart shows in the face; if the facial complexion is pale, it might be because of insufficient qi and blood. A recent case I encountered was about winter pestilence; initially, the patient felt only fever, without realizing it was a heat pattern, but later it developed into intestinal tuberculosis, truly causing concern. Upon treatment, it was found that he also had symptoms of phlegm蕴脾, requiring regulation and harmonization of the spleen and stomach, and transformation and elimination of phlegm and dampness. Additionally, another patient, due to prolonged熬夜, led to difficulty in distinguishing true or false deficiency and excess, with disordered lung governing management and regulation, resulting in persistent coughing. These situations all remind us that in our daily lives, we need to pay attention to nourishing the body and maintaining good living habits.

在治疗积聚类病时，我们常采用八不传的原则，以确保患者在接受汗法或平旦服等治疗方法时，能够有效清除体内的气分热证。对于一些较为严重的病症如乳发，我们则需要结合清气凉血的方法，并辅以豁痰开窍来达到更好的疗效。这一系列的治疗方法不仅体现了中医辨证施治的精髓，也展示了中医在处理复杂疾病时的独特优势。||In treating diseases of abdominal masses, we often adopt the principle of "Eight types of people should be declined to learn Taiji" to ensure that patients can effectively clear the heat pattern in the qi level when receiving sweating methods or taking before breakfast. For more severe conditions such as acute septic mastitis, we need to combine the method of clearing qi and cooling blood, supplemented by transforming phlegm and opening the orifices to achieve better therapeutic effects. This series of treatment methods not only embodies the essence of syndrome differentiation in TCM but also demonstrates the unique advantages of TCM in dealing with complex diseases.

最近有位朋友向我诉说，他总是感觉身体疲惫不堪，尤其到了下午更是觉得无力，晚上还经常失眠，有时甚至会出现耳闭的症状，严重影响了日常生活。我推测这可能是脾肾气虚不固证的表现。建议他平时可以多吃一些健脾补肾的食物，并尝试用解郁安神的方法来改善睡眠。同时，由于他的工作需要长时间对着电脑，可能会导致肺部不适，出现类似肺积的情况，所以也需要注意呼吸顺畅，可以适当做一些宣肺化痰的练习。如果症状持续不见好转，还是建议及时就医，毕竟健康才是最重要的。||Recently, a friend told me that he always feels extremely fatigued, especially in the afternoon, and he often experiences insomnia at night, sometimes even ear block, which seriously affects his daily life. I speculate this might be the manifestation of the pattern of insecurity of the spleen and kidney qi deficiency. It is recommended that he eat more foods that tonify the spleen and kidney on a regular basis, and try methods to relieve stagnation and calm the mind to improve sleep. At the same time, due to his work requiring prolonged periods facing a computer, it may lead to discomfort in the lungs and symptoms similar to masses in the lung, so attention should also be paid to smooth breathing, and appropriate exercises for disperse the lung and transform phlegm can be done.

最近在研究中医的三因学说，发现生活中很多常见病症都和这些理论息息相关。比如我最近遇到一个患者，他经常感到阴虚肺燥证，咳嗽不止，喉咙不适，甚至有时会出现喉癣的症状。还有一位患者，由于饮食不当导致气臌，腹部胀满。另外，我发现小孩子容易患走马牙疳，这需要我们特别注意口腔卫生。治疗上，我会用一些止血剂来缓解症状，同时也会用到背法来调理身体。当然，如果是在阳明经证的情况下，治疗方式又会有所不同。希望我的分享能帮助大家更好地理解和预防这些疾病。||Recently, while studying the Theory of three etiological categories in Traditional Chinese Medicine, I found that many common diseases in life are closely related to these theories. For instance, I recently encountered a patient who often experienced the Lung heat and yin deficiency pattern, with persistent cough, sore throat, and sometimes even symptoms of Tuberculosis of the throat. Another patient suffered from Qi tympanites due to improper diet, leading to abdominal distension. Additionally, I discovered that children are prone to Acute ulcerative gingivitis, which requires us to pay special attention to oral hygiene. In treatment, I use some Formulas that stop bleeding to alleviate symptoms, and also apply Back-carrying manipulation for body regulation. Of course, if it is under the Yangming meridian pattern, the treatment method would be different. I hope my sharing can help everyone better understand and prevent these diseases.

Furthermore, she has been experiencing severe constipation recently, which may be a manifestation of the large intestine fluid deficiency pattern; I advised her to drink more water and exercise appropriately to improve her intestinal environment. Finally, I examined her pulse conditions and found them indeed to be somewhat abnormal. I hope my suggestions can help her, and also remind everyone to pay attention to their health and make timely adjustments.

最近在学习中医知识时，发现很多有趣的理论。比如“关脉”和“五输穴”，这些都在帮助我们更好地理解身体的奥秘。还有，“缩阴”和“圆裆”的练习，据说能增强体质，提升生活质量。但要注意，如果出现“饮停胸胁证”或“痰热内闭证”，则需要及时调理，避免发展成更严重的“精癃”。通过日常的小习惯，如保持正确的坐姿，可以有效预防这些问题。希望大家都能关注自己的身体健康，享受中医带来的益处。||Recently, while learning TCM knowledge, I discovered many interesting theories. For example, "Guan pulse" and "Five-Shu points," these are all helping us better understand the mysteries of the body. Additionally, practices such as "genital retraction" and "round crotch" are said to enhance physical constitution and improve quality of life. However, it's important to note that if "fluid retention in chest and hypochondrium syndrome" or "phlegm heat blocked the interior syndrome" occur, timely adjustment is necessary to avoid progression into more serious "prostate enlargement." Through daily small habits, such as maintaining proper sitting posture, these issues can be effectively prevented. I hope everyone will pay attention to their own physical health and enjoy the benefits brought by TCM.

在日常生活中，我们常常会遇到一些看似平常却暗藏健康隐患的症状。比如有些朋友可能会出现口辛的情况，这可能是脾胃功能失调的表现。而当我们讨论如何调理时，不仅需要辨病，更要内外相合，通过调整生活方式和饮食习惯来达到神气鼓荡的效果。对于孕妇来说，妊娠脉的变化尤为重要，它能帮助我们了解母体与胎儿的健康状况。在治疗过程中，得气是针灸治疗的关键，也是患者感受疗效的重要标志。当然，在选择药材时，修制也是一门学问，好的药材才能更好地发挥药效。总之，中医不仅仅是治病，更是调养身心，让我们一起学习更多中医知识，共同守护健康。||In daily life, we often encounter some seemingly ordinary symptoms that conceal health risks. For example, some friends may experience a pungent taste in their mouth, which could be a manifestation of disharmony in the spleen and stomach functions. When discussing how to regulate these conditions, it's not only necessary to differentiate diseases but also to achieve internal-external unity by adjusting lifestyles and dietary habits to attain the effect of shen-qi movement. For pregnant women, changes in the pregnancy pulse are particularly important as they help us understand the health status of both the mother and the fetus. During the treatment process, the arrival of qi is crucial in acupuncture therapy and also an important sign for patients to feel the therapeutic effects. Of course, when selecting medicinal materials, medicinal processing is also a discipline; only high-quality herbs can better exert their efficacy. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine is not just about curing diseases but also nurturing the body and mind. Let's learn more about traditional Chinese medicine together and jointly safeguard our health.

在本次研究中，我们探讨了心脾两虚证与偏痹之间的关系，发现心脾两虚证患者常伴有小便黄赤、多梦等症状，舌象表现为舌质淡、苔薄白，脉象则多见涩脉。此外，针对胃寒饮停证患者，我们亦观察到类似的小便黄赤现象，提示该症状可能与多种证候相关。治疗上，对于心脾两虚证合并偏痹者，采用清心泻肺法以调和气血，缓解偏痹症状；而对于胃寒饮停证，则需温阳化饮，佐以活血通络之品，避免病情进一步发展为胎疮等严重后果。||In this study, we explored the relationship between the pattern of deficiency of the heart and spleen and hemiparalysis, finding that patients with this pattern often present symptoms such as yellow, reddish urine and excessive dreaming. The tongue manifestation is characterized by a pale tongue body and thin white coating, while the pulse condition predominantly shows hesitant pulse. Additionally, for patients with the pattern of cold fluids retention in the stomach, we also observed similar symptoms of yellow, reddish urine, indicating that this symptom may be related to various patterns. In treatment, for those with hemiparalysis combined with the pattern of deficiency of the heart and spleen, the method of clearing heat in the heart and lung is used to regulate and harmonize qi and blood, alleviating the symptoms of hemiparalysis; whereas for the pattern of cold fluids retention in the stomach, it is necessary to warm and transform cold fluid retention, supplemented with products that harmonize meridians and unblock channels to avoid further development of severe consequences such as pediatric eczema.

最近有朋友问我关于手脚冰凉的问题，说是一到冬天手足厥冷就特别严重，晚上睡觉时还会出现血脉不畅的情况，这其实是气血运行不畅导致的，中医认为这与六郁有关，尤其是气郁会导致血随气逆。在日常生活中，我们可以通过推拿复合手法类来缓解症状，比如轻轻按摩可以促进血液循环，同时要注意关门不利，避免寒气入侵。如果情况较为严重，可能需要通过针灸等方法调整体内气血，有时医生会用到代脉来判断病情。另外，平时也可以适当采用报刺法以达到疏通经络的目的。总之，保持良好的生活习惯和合理的饮食结构对于改善这类问题非常关键。||Recently, a friend asked me about the problem of cold hands and feet, saying that it becomes particularly severe in winter when there is a serious case of cold limbs, and during sleep, there is a situation of blood circulation not being smooth, which is actually caused by the poor circulation of Qi and Blood. In TCM, this is related to the Six Stagnations, especially Qi stagnation can lead to Blood flowing with rebellious Qi. In daily life, we can alleviate symptoms through Compound Tuina manipulations, for example, gentle massage can promote blood circulation, while also paying attention to the water gate failing to operate, to avoid the invasion of cold pathogenic factors. If the condition is more severe, it may be necessary to adjust the internal Qi and Blood through methods such as acupuncture, sometimes doctors will use Regularly Intermittent Pulse to judge the condition. Additionally, one can appropriately adopt Successive Trigger Needling to achieve the purpose of unblocking the meridians. In short, maintaining good living habits and a reasonable dietary structure is very critical for improving such problems.

最近有朋友问我关于身体的一些疑惑，比如为何会出现便秘的情况，我告诉他这可能是因为体内湿气过重导致的，需要使用一些清热药来帮助润肠泄热。同时，我们还要关注肝血是否充足，因为肝血不足也会引起一系列不适。在日常生活中，我们要注重脏腑相合，比如六阳脉和十五络脉的调理，保持气血畅通。另外，如果舌苔呈现为腐苔，可能是体内湿寒过重，这时可以采用温阳化饮的方法来调理。总之，养生保健需从细节入手，希望大家都能健康生活。||Recently, a friend asked me about some doubts regarding his body, such as why constipation occurs. I told him this might be due to excessive dampness in the body, which requires the use of interior heat-clearing medicines to help moisten the intestine and clear heat. At the same time, we should also pay attention to whether liver blood is sufficient, as insufficient liver blood can also cause a series of discomforts. In daily life, we should focus on the mutual interconnection of Zang-fu organs, such as the regulation of the six yang pulses and the fifteen collaterals, to maintain smooth flow of qi and blood. Additionally, if the tongue coating appears as curdy coating, it may indicate excessive internal damp-cold; at this time, we can adopt the method of warming yang and transforming water retention for adjustment. In short, health preservation needs to start from the details; I hope everyone can live a healthy life.

在探讨燥易伤肺与温补肺阳的治疗策略时，我们注意到患者常表现为闷痛及淡紫舌，此乃肺功能失调之征象。结合临床观察，运用穴位注射疗法，可以有效改善上述症状。此外，对于伴有太阳蓄血证的患者，需综合考虑其气血运行状态，采用和中安神之法以调和机体。值得注意的是，在治疗过程中，对疳积患者的调理亦不可忽视，因其与整体健康状况密切相关。通过上述方法，我们期待达到标本兼治的效果，进一步提高临床疗效。||In discussing the syndrome of dryness easily damaging the lung and the treatment strategy of warming and tonifying lung Yang, we observe that patients often present with oppressive pain and a pale purple tongue, which are manifestations of dysfunction in lung function. Combining clinical observations, the use of point injection therapy can effectively improve the aforementioned symptoms. Additionally, for patients with the Taiyang blood retention pattern, it is necessary to comprehensively consider their Qi and Blood circulation status and adopt methods to harmonize the middle jiao and calm the mind to regulate the body. It is noteworthy that during the treatment process, the adjustment of patients with mild malnutrition with food stagnation should not be neglected, as it is closely related to overall health.

在探讨阴虚津亏证与瘀热入络证的治疗策略时，我们发现小方的应用具有显著效果。特别是在阴虚津亏证的治疗中，通过固涩摄乳与温化寒痰的结合，能够有效改善患者症状。此外，对于瘀热入络证，采用温化寒痰剂进行治疗，亦能取得良好疗效。同时，在临床实践中，导引作为一种辅助治疗方法，对促进囊虫病患者的康复也起到重要作用。综上所述，合理运用上述方法和药物，能够更好地服务于患者的健康需求。||In exploring the treatment strategies for Yin fluids deficiency pattern and Stasis and heat entering the meridians pattern, we found that the application of Minor formulas has significant effects. Especially in treating Yin fluids deficiency pattern, by combining Tonify qi and astringe the breast milk with Warm and transform cold phlegm, we can effectively improve patient symptoms. Additionally, for Stasis and heat entering the meridians pattern, using formulas that warm and transform cold phlegm also achieves good therapeutic outcomes. Meanwhile, in clinical practice, Daoyin (guiding and stretching) as an auxiliary treatment method plays a crucial role in promoting the recovery of patients with Cysticercosis. In summary, reasonably applying the aforementioned methods and medications can better serve the health needs of patients.

最近春意盎然，正是春夏养阳的好时节。大家在日常生活中不妨多晒晒太阳，增强体质。我最近在门诊时遇到一位患者，他面色苍白，畏寒怕冷，这显然是实寒证的表现。经过一番辨证施治，我决定采用扶正补气的方法，并辅以悬灸来温通经络。此外，我还建议他多吃一些温热性质的食物，如姜和葱，避免生冷食物。另一位患者则出现了热入气分证的症状，表现为发热口渴，我给他开了些清热解毒的方子，并配合豁痰燥的治疗方法。中医讲究因人而异，同一种病症在不同人体内表现可能大不相同，因此治疗也要灵活变通。记得保持良好的生活习惯，适当运动，才能更好地调养身体，预防疾病。||Recently, with the arrival of spring, it is a good time to protect Yang in spring and summer. In daily life, everyone should try to get more sun exposure to enhance physical fitness. Recently, when I was seeing patients in the clinic, I encountered one whose facial complexion was pale and who had cold intolerance, which are obvious manifestations of an excess cold pattern. After careful pattern differentiation, I decided to use the method of tonifying qi and supplementing anti-pathogenic qi, supplemented by suspended moxibustion to warm and unblock the meridians and collaterals. Additionally, I recommended that he eat more warming foods such as ginger and green onions and avoid cold and raw foods. Another patient presented symptoms of heat entering the qi phase pattern, characterized by fever and thirst; I prescribed a formula to clear heat and remove toxins and combined it with a treatment to resolve phlegm and dry dampness.

在日常生活中，我们经常会遇到一些小病小痛，比如轻微的水火烫伤，这时候我们可以使用一些简单的家庭疗法，如用解表清热的方法来缓解症状。另外，如果感觉身体不适，尤其是出现肺实热证的症状时，可以考虑通过饮食调理，多吃一些滋阴润燥剂的食物，如梨和百合。同时，对于那些经常感到胸闷腹胀的人来说，行气消痞是非常重要的，可以通过适当的运动和按摩来进行。中医认为，每个人的体质不同，所以治疗方案也会有所不同，比如针对风热犯表证的人群，可能需要更加注重调节体内的阴阳平衡，而岁会等节气的变化也会影响到我们的健康状态，因此顺应自然规律进行调养是十分必要的。||In daily life, we often encounter minor ailments such as slight burns and scalds. At this time, we can use some simple home remedies, such as using the method of releasing the exterior and clearing heat to alleviate symptoms. Additionally, if one feels unwell, especially when experiencing symptoms of excess heat in the lung pattern, it is advisable to consider dietary adjustments, consuming more foods that nourish yin and moisten dryness, such as pears and lilies. Meanwhile, for those who frequently feel chest tightness and abdominal distension, it is crucial to regulate qi and resolve masses, which can be achieved through appropriate exercise and massage. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), each person's constitution is different; therefore, treatment plans also vary. For example, for individuals with the wind heat invading the exterior pattern, it may be necessary to pay more attention to regulating the body's yin-yang balance. The changes in annual congruence and other solar terms also affect our health status; thus, it is essential to follow the natural laws for conditioning.

中医认为“气为血之帅”，在治疗脾胃疾病时，“理气消痞”尤为重要。若患者出现“脾阴不足”，常伴随“泛酸”症状，此时需采用“大泻刺”法调理。“清热化毒”也是治疗过程中不可或缺的手段，尤其对于“含腮疮”的患者来说更为重要。同时，若体质表现为“卫强营弱”，则更需注重调和阴阳，以达到治病的目的。||In TCM, "Qi is the commander of the blood," and when treating spleen and stomach diseases, "regulating qi and resolving masses" is particularly important. If a patient presents with "spleen yin deficiency," they often experience symptoms of "acid regurgitation." In this case, the "great drainage needling" method should be used for regulation. "Clearing heat and transforming toxicity" is also an indispensable approach in the treatment process, especially for patients with "mumps." At the same time, if the constitution shows "strong Wei-defense and weak Ying-nutrition," then it is even more necessary to focus on harmonizing Yin and Yang to achieve the goal of treating the disease.

Herbs such as honeysuckle and forsythia can help clear heat and preserve jin (thin body fluids). If symptoms such as mouth ulcers or excessive phlegm appear, it may be a manifestation of exuberant heat in the Ying nutrients phase inside the body, and one can appropriately drink some tea to clear heat and reduce fire. For those with foot qi issues, pay attention to eating light food to avoid the occurrence of cold retention in the stomach and intestines pattern.

Additionally, it is currently the transitional period between seasons, which is also a high incidence period for pediatric schistosomiasis; parents must pay attention to prevention. Speaking of regulation, we cannot overlook the importance of gallbladder qi, which is closely related to emotions and sleep.

For instance, some people may experience hiccups, which could be due to the presence of the five endogenous pathogenic factors within the body, leading to poor qi movement. For such conditions, we can try adjusting our breathing through the method of opening with breathing out and closing with breathing in to promote the circulation of qi and blood. If constipation is also present, then clearing heat and promoting bowel movements becomes particularly important, aiding in the elimination of internal heat toxins. At the same time, if there's a stasis obstructing the essence chamber pattern, it indicates possible blood stasis, and at this point, one might consider using methods to circulate blood and eliminate stasis. Of course, if the symptoms are more complex, such as having excess metal failing to sound along with hiccups, it would require the comprehensive use of various methods, like transforming phlegm and opening the orifices, to achieve entering of exterior patterns and exiting of interior patterns, ultimately restoring health.

In nursing care, attention should be paid to avoiding carphology in the child to prevent aggravation of the condition. Additionally, wrapping the crotch for warmth should not be neglected. If symptoms such as hot sweats and vomiting appear, it may indicate that pathogenic heat is disturbing the spleen and stomach internally; treatment should focus on dispelling wind, drying dampness, and harmonizing stomach qi. The gallbladder meridian of foot-Shaoyang is closely related to this disease; acupuncture at the meridian points of this channel can assist in treatment.

春季到来，天气转暖，但有时寒气仍未完全退去，我们需要注意预防冻疮的发生。饮食上要清淡，避免食用过于辛辣刺激的食物，以免引发六淫之邪。最近我发现有些人出现了肠道不适的情况，这可能是由于肠风伤络证引起的，建议及时调理。小孩子要注意营养均衡，避免出现乳疳的情况。另外，记得定期驱虫，以防寸白虫病。在日常生活中，我们要学会行气消痞，保持良好的生活习惯，如果出现阳厥症状，要及时就医调理。通过这些方法，我们可以更好地维护身体健康。||In spring, as the weather warms up, but the coldness has not completely receded, we need to pay attention to preventing frostbite. Diet should be light, avoiding overly spicy and stimulating foods to prevent the invasion of the six excesses. Recently, I have found that some people are experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort, which might be due to the pattern of wind damaging intestinal collaterals; it is recommended to adjust in time. Children should pay attention to balanced nutrition to avoid the occurrence of eczematous carcinoma of the nipple. Additionally, remember to deworm regularly to prevent taeniasis. In daily life, we should learn to regulate qi and resolve masses, maintaining good living habits. If symptoms of yang syncope appear, seek medical treatment promptly.

在探讨中医的整体观念时，我们不仅要关注局部症状，还要考虑到患者全身的状态。例如，对于风中经络证的治疗，我们除了使用拔伸法缓解局部症状外，还需要注重调理脾胃，以应对可能伴随的脾痟。在某些情况下，如遇到禁口痢这样的病症时，还需结合患者的具体情况，采取相应的治疗方法。同时，皮痹作为常见的皮肤病，其治疗也需遵循整体观念，不可仅限于皮肤表面的处理。对于孕痈这类特殊时期的疾病，更需要细心辨证施治，确保母婴安全。而关于敞裆这一现象，虽然不常见于现代中医文献，但在特定历史背景下，它与某些疾病的关联仍值得研究。||When discussing the holistic concept in Traditional Chinese Medicine, we must not only focus on local symptoms but also consider the patient's overall condition. For instance, in treating the Wind attacking the meridians pattern, besides using pulling-stretching manipulation to alleviate local symptoms, it is necessary to regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach to address potential spleen wasting. In some cases, such as encountering closed-mouth dysentery, corresponding treatments should be adopted based on the specific circumstances of the patient. Meanwhile, as a common skin disease, the treatment of skin impediment also needs to follow the holistic concept and cannot be limited to surface-level management of the skin. For diseases like acute appendicitis during pregnancy, more meticulous pattern differentiation and treatment are required to ensure the safety of both mother and child. As for open crotch, although it is not commonly found in modern TCM literature, its association with certain diseases under specific historical contexts still warrants research.

Her mother has been experiencing chest bi-impediment/cardiac pain recently, and sometimes she also suffers from whooping cough. After I introduced some methods for regulation, she mentioned that her child had developed pustules, and asked me to take a look. I suggested she start by regulating the yin deficiency of the spleen and stomach pattern, while also paying attention to removing toxins and dispersing the lung. The opening of the five zang organs is also very important. Additionally, she mentioned that her mother had a history of postpartum tetanus, which made me pay even more attention to the issues of the opening of the five zang organs and chest bi-impediment/cardiac pain. I hope my suggestions can help them, and remind everyone to pay more attention to their family members' health and regulate it in time.

中医认为，卫营同病常表现为多种症状，如黄水疮和大头瘟等，这些病症往往需要通过活血止痛、化毒消肿的方法来治疗。在妇科疾病中，乳癌患者亦可见类似表现，治疗时需辨证施治，采用相应疗法。此外，情绪波动引起的喜证也可能伴随上述症状出现，治疗时需兼顾调理情志。对于喉岩这类咽喉疾病，同样需要运用化毒消肿的原则进行处理。在临床实践中，综合运用以上方法对症下药，才能取得较好的疗效。||In TCM, the disease involving both the Wei-defense and Ying-nutrients often presents with various symptoms such as Yellow-water sore and Swollen face. These conditions usually require treatment through methods like circulating blood to alleviate pain and remove toxins to resolve swelling. In gynecological diseases, patients with Breast cancer may also exhibit similar manifestations; during treatment, it is necessary to identify the pattern and apply corresponding therapies accordingly. Additionally, Excessive joy pattern caused by emotional fluctuations may accompany the aforementioned symptoms, hence during treatment, it is essential to regulate emotions.

在中医理论中，补阳是治疗阳气不足的重要方法之一，适用于多种疾病如骨痨等。对于因外感风寒引发的痧病，采用补阳疗法可以增强机体抵抗力。若患者出现声嘶症状，可能是由于热实结胸证导致，此时需结合补心安神以缓解症状。而针对脑萎患者，除了补阳之外，还需关注其饮食起居，避免外关内格的发生。总之，在临床实践中，合理运用这些治疗方法能够有效改善患者的健康状况。||In TCM theory, tonifying Yang is one of the important methods for treating insufficient Yang qi, applicable to various diseases such as bone tuberculosis. For sand-like exanthem caused by external wind-cold invasion, using Yang tonification therapy can enhance the body's resistance. If the patient presents with hoarseness, it may be due to the pattern of exuberant heat affecting the chest, in which case nourishing the heart and calming the mind should be combined to alleviate symptoms. As for cerebral atrophy patients, in addition to tonifying Yang, attention should also be paid to their diet and living habits to avoid external blockage and internal rejection. In short, in clinical practice, reasonably applying these treatment methods can effectively improve the patient's health condition.

在探讨精癃与肾间动气的关系时，我们发现二者虽表现各异，但皆与肾脏功能失调有关。太仓，即脾胃，其运化功能对全身气血津液的生成至关重要，而脾主肌肉，对于维持肌肉健康同样重要。菜乌紫病并非现代医学疾病名称，但在某些文献中可能指代一种因气血瘀滞导致皮肤呈现异常颜色的病症。针对胆疸，临床观察发现其常与脾胃湿热有关，治疗上需注重调理脾胃，清利湿热。酒厥，多由饮酒过量，湿热内生，导致气机逆乱所致，治疗时需以醒脾化湿为先。小儿风痧则是一种常见于儿童的外感疾病，治疗时除疏风解表外，还需兼顾调和脾胃。通过上述分析可见，中医理论体系中各脏腑之间存在着密切联系，治疗时需综合考虑，方能取得良好疗效。||In discussing the relationship between essence dysuria and the origin of vital qi, we find that although they manifest differently, both are related to dysfunction of the kidney. The great granary, namely the spleen and stomach, plays a crucial role in the production of qi, blood, and body fluids throughout the body, while the spleen governs muscles, which is equally important for maintaining muscle health. Pickles cyanosis is not a disease name in modern medicine, but it may refer to a condition in some literature where skin color appears abnormal due to stagnation of qi and blood. Regarding cholestasis, clinical observations have found it is often associated with damp-heat in the spleen and stomach; treatment should focus on regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach, clearing and promoting the excretion of dampness and heat. Alcoholic syncope is mostly caused by excessive drinking, leading to internal generation of damp-heat, resulting in disorder of qi movement; treatment should prioritize invigorating the spleen and resolving dampness. Wind rashes in children is a common external infection disease in children; during treatment, besides dispersing wind and resolving exterior symptoms, it is also necessary to consider regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach. Through the above analysis, it can be seen that there is a close relationship among the zang-fu organs in the theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine, and treatment needs to take into account comprehensively to achieve good therapeutic effects.

Studies have shown that the occurrence of furuncles is closely related to the dysfunction of the pairing between the spleen and stomach, while epidemic hemorrhagic fever often manifests as Taiyang-fu organ pattern or Taiyin pattern. During the treatment process, it is necessary to focus on nourishing liver yin to improve the internal environment. For patients with phlegm turbidity obstructing the middle jiao, corresponding measures should be taken to regulate the zang-fu organ functions and promote recovery from the disease.

在中医理论中，拿揉法常用于调理脾胃功能，对于脾气亏虚证有着显著疗效。过逸则容易导致气血运行不畅，进而引发各种疾病。闻诊类是诊断疾病的重要手段之一，通过听患者的声音变化可以初步判断病情。在《黄帝内经》中提到的十二正经证类，更是全面涵盖了人体生理病理的各种表现。例如戴眼反折这一症状，常常提示病势危重；而点刺舌则是观察舌象变化的一种方法，对于诊断某些疾病具有重要参考价值。睑弦赤烂则多见于肝胆湿热或风热上扰之症，需结合其他症状综合分析。||In TCM theory, the grasping-kneading manipulation is often used to regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach, showing significant efficacy for the spleen qi deficiency pattern. Physical inactivity can easily lead to stagnation of qi and blood, thereby triggering various diseases. Auscultation and olfaction is one of the important methods for diagnosing diseases; by listening to changes in the patient's voice, the condition can be preliminarily judged. The patterns of the twelve regular meridians mentioned in the Huangdi Neijing comprehensively cover various physiological and pathological manifestations of the human body. For example, the symptom of eyes fixed upward often indicates a critical condition; while spotted tongue is a method for observing changes in tongue manifestations, which has important reference value for diagnosing certain diseases. Red, wet and ulcerative eyelid is mostly seen in cases of liver and gallbladder damp-heat or wind-heat disturbing upward, and needs to be analyzed in combination with other symptoms.

在中医理论中，卫行脉外的气与邪气相互作用是导致疾病的重要因素之一。例如，瘾疹的发生往往与外界风邪侵袭有关，治疗时需要通过解表攻下来驱除体表的邪气。同时，观察舌象中的染苔变化可以判断疾病的性质和进展，如湿热内蕴常表现为黄腻苔。在诊断过程中，我们还需关注患者的整体状况，包括阴阳平衡及五化状态。例如，阴虚火旺的患者可能会出现舌红少津，治疗上需注重滋阴降火。此外，开呼合吸的呼吸调养也是辅助治疗的重要环节，有助于改善肺功能，促进气血运行。||In TCM theory, the Qi of Wei-defence circulating outside the vessels interacts with pathogenic qi, which is one of the important factors leading to disease. For example, the occurrence of urticaria is often related to the invasion of external pathogenic wind; treatment needs to be carried out by releasing the exterior and purging the interior to expel the pathogenic factors from the body surface. At the same time, observing changes in the stained coating on the tongue can determine the nature and progression of the disease; for instance, internal damp-heat often manifests as a yellow greasy tongue coating. In the diagnostic process, we also need to pay attention to the patient's overall condition, including the balance of Yin-Yang and the state of the Five transformations. For example, patients with Yin deficiency leading to fire hyperactivity may present with a red tongue with little thin fluids, and treatment should focus on nourishing and supplementing yin fluids and reducing fire. Additionally, opening with breathing out and closing with breathing in in respiratory regulation is also an important part of auxiliary treatment, which helps improve lung function and promote the circulation of Qi and Blood.

For some symptoms caused by long-term pneumoconiosis leading to physical weakness, we can enhance physical constitution by tonifying Yang, while using a Guasha tool for localized scraping to help restore the drop of the buttocks. Additionally, for certain benign tumors such as fleshy tumors, Traditional Chinese Medicine also has unique therapeutic methods. Through the aforementioned comprehensive approaches, we can effectively improve the patient's overall health condition.

在探讨鼻病类疾病时，我们注意到鼻疳作为一种常见病症，其发生与两仪失衡密切相关。据《黄帝内经》记载，人体阴阳平衡是健康之本，而鼻病的发生则常源于阴阳失调。本文旨在通过分析初关阶段的临床表现，结合气能摄血理论，探讨汤剂在治疗鼻疳中的应用。研究表明，合理运用石蛾等药材配伍的汤剂，可以有效改善鼻疳症状，恢复患者健康。同时，对于痹证的治疗亦有启示，提示我们在临床实践中重视药物的选择与配伍。通过对上述理论与实践的综合分析，本文进一步论证了中医辨证施治在鼻病治疗中的重要性。||In exploring nasal diseases, we have noted that nasal sores, as a common condition, are closely related to the disharmony of the two complementary forces. According to the Huangdi Neijing, the balance between Yin and Yang is the foundation of health, while the occurrence of nasal diseases often originates from the disharmony between Yin and Yang. This article aims to analyze the clinical manifestations at the initial stage through the lens of Qi controlling blood theory, and discuss the application of decoctions in treating nasal sores. Research indicates that the rational use of decoctions with herb compatibility such as Stony tonsillitis can effectively improve symptoms of nasal sores and restore patient health. At the same time, it provides enlightenment for the treatment of joint impediment disorders, suggesting the importance of emphasizing drug selection and compatibility in clinical practice. Through comprehensive analysis of the above theories and practices, this paper further argues the significance of syndrome differentiation and treatment in the context of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of nasal diseases.

同名经配穴法是中医针灸治疗中的重要方法之一，通过选取同名经上的穴位进行治疗。比如，在温病治疗过程中，我们可以采用此法配合使用补阳药来增强疗效。同时，根据患者的具体情况，我们还可以选择使用直刺或留罐法以达到更好的治疗效果。值得注意的是，心其华在面，说明面部皮肤状态与心脏健康密切相关，因此在治疗时也需关注面部的变化。此外，手太阳小肠经和同岁会也是我们在临床实践中常用的几个概念，它们在整体治疗方案中发挥着不可替代的作用。||The method of point combination of the same-name meridians is one of the important methods in acupuncture treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. By selecting acupoints on the same-name meridians for treatment, we can achieve therapeutic effects. For instance, during the treatment of warm diseases, we can use this method in conjunction with Yang-tonifying medicines to enhance efficacy. At the same time, based on the patient's specific condition, we can choose to use perpendicular needle insertion or cup retention to achieve better therapeutic outcomes. It is worth noting that the lustre of the heart shows in the face, indicating that the facial skin condition is closely related to heart health; therefore, changes in the face should also be taken into consideration during treatment. Additionally, the small intestine meridian of hand-Taiyang and identical annual congruence are several concepts we commonly use in clinical practice, and they play an irreplaceable role in the overall treatment plan.

在探讨精室瘀阻证与流痰的关系时，我们发现二者虽有不同，却也存在内在联系。流痰作为一种慢性疾病，常伴随寒战出现，而精室瘀阻证则多见于男性患者，表现为局部疼痛和不适。津血同源理论提示我们，人体津液与血液之间有着密切的关系，因此在治疗过程中需要注重润下，保持体内津液充足，避免干燥。同时，对于乳糜尿患者而言，这种理论同样适用，需注意调理饮食，避免食用过于油腻的食物。此外，藏象学说认为人体内部器官的功能状态可以通过体表变化反映出来，如蛇丹即带状疱疹的发生可能与体内某些脏腑功能失调有关。综合以上分析，在临床实践中应当灵活运用这些理论，以达到更好的治疗效果。||When exploring the relationship between stasis obstructing the essence chamber pattern and flowing phlegm, we find that although they have differences, there is an intrinsic connection. As a chronic disease, flowing phlegm often occurs with chills, while stasis obstructing the essence chamber pattern is more commonly seen in male patients, manifesting as local pain and discomfort. The theory of body fluids and blood sharing the same source suggests that there is a close relationship between body fluids and blood in the human body; therefore, during treatment, it is necessary to emphasize moistening and descending to maintain adequate body fluids within the body and avoid dryness. At the same time, for patients with chyluria, this theory also applies, and attention should be paid to regulating diet, avoiding overly greasy foods. Additionally, the theory of visceral manifestations suggests that the functional state of internal organs can be reflected through changes on the body surface, such as snake-shaped sore (herpes zoster) possibly being related to dysfunction of certain internal organs. In summary, in clinical practice, these theories should be flexibly applied to achieve better therapeutic effects.

I still remember once a friend accidentally got injured by pine caterpillars, which was really worrying. Traditional Chinese Medicine considers this within the scope of exterior-interior pairing acupoint therapy, and acupuncture treatment can effectively alleviate symptoms. Regarding constitution, earth personality individuals should pay attention to conditioning and avoid overwork leading to liver qi deficiency pattern. Additionally, health preservation should also take into account eight directions, not just one aspect. Finally, for chronic diseases like bone flaccidity, doing some gentle exercises regularly can enhance physical fitness, which is very helpful.

在日常生活中，我们常常会遇到一些小毛病，比如久泄和津液亏虚证，这些都是需要细心调理的。记得调理时要注意体内的升降出入，保持平衡。说到平衡，就不得不提脾主统血，这是维持身体健康的重要原则之一。煎药火候的掌握也至关重要，它直接影响到药物的效果。最近，我注意到一些朋友因为长时间的伏邪导致身体不适，其实这可以通过适当的运动来改善，比如溜臀这样的小动作，就能帮助疏通经络。另外，关于男性健康的话题，宗筋的问题也是不可忽视的，合理的饮食和生活习惯是关键。希望这些分享对大家有所帮助！||In daily life, we often encounter some minor ailments, such as chronic diarrhea and fluids deficiency pattern, which all require careful adjustment. Remember to pay attention to the ascending, descending, entering, and exiting within the body when adjusting, and maintain balance. Speaking of balance, it is impossible not to mention that the spleen holds blood, which is one of the important principles for maintaining physical health. Mastering the heat control in decoction is also crucial as it directly affects the efficacy of the medicine. Recently, I noticed that some friends have felt unwell due to latent pathogenic qi for a long time; actually, this can be improved through appropriate exercise, such as the small action of dropping the buttocks, which can help unblock the meridians and collaterals. Additionally, regarding male health, the issue of the gathering of muscle around the genital region should not be ignored; reasonable diet and lifestyle are key points. I hope these shares will be helpful to everyone!

本研究旨在探讨邪热伤阴证与肺热炽盛证在食瘕患者中的临床表现及治疗策略。通过分析病例，我们发现此类患者常伴有肝阳上亢证，其主要症状表现为胸闷烦躁、口干舌燥等。针对上述证候，治疗时应注重行气散结以改善症状，同时辅以泻火攻下之法清除体内积热。此外，对于伴随出血症状者，推荐使用固崩止带剂以达到止血效果；而对于便秘患者，则需应用润下剂以促进肠道蠕动，从而实现整体疗效的提升。||This study aims to explore the clinical manifestations and treatment strategies of the pathogenic heat damaging yin pattern and the exuberance of lung heat pattern in patients with stomach masses due to food retention. Through case analysis, we found that such patients often present with the liver yang ascendant hyperactivity pattern, with main symptoms including chest stuffiness, restlessness, dry mouth, etc. For the above syndromes, during treatment, it is important to regulate qi and resolve masses to improve symptoms, while also using fire-clearing purgation methods to eliminate internal accumulated heat. Additionally, for those with accompanying bleeding symptoms, it is recommended to use formulas that stop bleeding/leucorrhoea to achieve hemostasis; for constipation patients, lubricating purgative formulas should be applied to promote intestinal peristalsis, thereby enhancing overall therapeutic effects.

最近在门诊中遇到不少外感咳嗽的朋友，他们往往因为季节变化而感到不适。对于这些朋友，我通常会采用点脊法配合留针拔罐来调理，效果颇佳。同时，也有些患者因为长期压力大，情绪波动导致的不育类病，治疗时我会用到阳中求阴的方法，帮助他们调节体内阴阳平衡。记得有一位患者，因为过度忧虑导致的恐胜喜，使得血室失和，我通过得神调理，最终使他恢复健康。生活中我们常常会遇到各种各样的健康问题，但只要我们找到合适的治疗方法，保持良好的心态，一切都会好起来的。||Recently, I have encountered many friends with coughs due to external contraction in the outpatient clinic, who often feel uncomfortable due to seasonal changes. For these friends, I usually adopt spine-pointing manipulation combined with needle-retention cupping for adjustment, which is quite effective. At the same time, there are also some patients suffering from sterility disorders caused by long-term stress and emotional fluctuations; when treating them, I use the method of seeking yin from yang to help regulate the balance of yin and yang inside their body. I remember a patient whose excessive worry led to fear prevailing over excess joy, causing disharmony in the blood chamber; through presence of spirit regulation, I finally helped him recover his health. In life, we often encounter various health problems, but as long as we find suitable treatment methods and maintain a good mindset, everything will get better.

春季来临，万物复苏，大家在享受大自然美好景色的同时也要警惕疾病的发生。比如春天是花粉过敏的高发期，有些人还会出现鼻痔的症状，这时候我们就可以用辛温通窍的方法来缓解，帮助鼻子通畅。另外，春天也是吃野菜的好时节，但是大家要注意不要误食毒蕈，以免引起毒蕈中毒。同时，对于胆气亏虚证患者来说，春天也是需要特别注意调理身体的时候，可以适当食用一些具有清热解毒功效的食物，预防疖的发生。此外，体内留饮过多也会影响健康，我们可以从饮食和生活习惯上入手，调养好我们的决渎之官，保持良好的身体状态。最后，如果孩子出现天花的症状，家长也不要过于紧张，及时就医并配合中药治疗，大多数情况下都能得到很好的恢复。||In spring, as all things revive, while enjoying the beautiful scenery of nature, we should also be alert to the occurrence of diseases. For example, spring is a high season for pollen allergies, and some people may experience symptoms of nasal polyps; at this time, we can use the method of dissipating cold and opening the orifices to alleviate symptoms and help unblock the nose. Additionally, spring is also a good season to eat wild vegetables, but everyone should be careful not to mistakenly consume toxic mushrooms to avoid mushroom poisoning. At the same time, for patients with the gallbladder qi deficiency pattern, spring is also a time that requires special attention to regulate the body, they can appropriately consume foods with the function of clearing heat and removing toxins to prevent the occurrence of furuncles. Moreover, excessive prolonged fluid retention within the body will also affect health, and we can start from diet and lifestyle habits to regulate our dredging and draining organ and maintain good physical condition. Finally, if children exhibit symptoms of smallpox, parents should not be overly nervous, timely medical treatment and cooperation with Chinese herbal medicines can generally achieve very good recovery in most cases.

燥邪侵袭人体易引发怔忡病，此时若伴有中焦虚寒证，则需采用温阳化饮之法调理，以免阳虚水停证加重病情。在治疗过程中，除内服药物外，还可结合按跷疗法促进气血流通，缓解战栗症状，同时避免使用峻下逐水药以防伤正气。||Pathogenic dryness invades the human body easily leading to fearful throbbing disease. If accompanied by a pattern of yang deficiency of the spleen and stomach, it is necessary to adopt the method of warming yang and transforming retained fluids for regulation, to prevent the aggravation of the condition due to the yang deficiency induced water retention pattern. During the treatment process, in addition to oral medication, Tuina therapy can also be combined to promote the circulation of Qi and Blood, alleviate shivering symptoms, while avoiding the use of drastic water-expelling medicines to prevent harm to healthy qi.

在治疗血热证时，我们需注意火耗气伤津的情况，根据患者具体情况因地制宜选择治疗方法。对于痈疡病症，采用缪刺或远道刺等针灸方法，以达到提脓拔毒的效果。同时，在治痈疡法中，化和营也是重要手段之一，通过调和营血，促进疮疡恢复。||In treating the blood heat syndrome, we need to pay attention to the condition of fire consuming qi and body fluids, and select treatment methods based on the patient's specific circumstances and local conditions. For abscess disorders, methods such as contralateral blood-letting or distal needling can be used to achieve the effect of drawing out pus and toxin. At the same time, in sore-/ulcer-resolving methods, harmonizing Ying-nutrient blood is also an important approach, promoting the recovery of sores and ulcers by regulating Ying-nutrient blood.

在临床实践中，我们观察到某些疾病晚期患者出现“回光返照”现象，此现象常与“中焦阴虚证”及“热盛伤阴证”密切相关。针对此类病症，“辨证论治”显得尤为重要，通过仔细分析病情，我们可以发现“肝郁血瘀证”亦是导致上述症状的关键因素之一。治疗上，需灵活运用中药方剂，例如采用“冷服”方式以减少药物对胃肠道的刺激，并结合针灸疗法，特别是“豹文刺”技术，以促进气血运行，缓解“肝郁血瘀证”。此外，从“五行胜复”的理论出发，我们还需考虑疾病的整体平衡，确保治疗方案既能针对当前症状，又能调整体内五行之间的相互关系，从而达到标本兼治的效果。||In clinical practice, we observe the "false spirit" phenomenon in some patients with advanced diseases, which is often closely related to the "yin deficiency of the spleen and stomach pattern" and the "exuberant heat damaging yin pattern". For such syndromes, "treatment based on pattern differentiation" is particularly important. Through careful analysis of the condition, we can find that the "liver qi stagnation with blood stasis pattern" is also one of the key factors leading to the aforementioned symptoms. In treatment, it is necessary to flexibly apply Chinese herbal formulas, for example, using the "take cold" method to reduce the stimulation of drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, and combining acupuncture therapy, especially the "leopard-spot needling" technique, to promote the circulation of qi and blood, alleviating the "liver qi stagnation with blood stasis pattern". Additionally, starting from the theory of "the five elements overcome and retaliate", we also need to consider the overall balance of the disease, ensuring that the treatment plan not only targets the current symptoms but also adjusts the mutual relationships among the five elements within the body, thus achieving the effect of treating both the tip and root.

暑伤津气证多见于夏秋之际，因高温导致体内津液亏损，若再感寒邪，则易形成寒凝血瘀证，表现为抽搐等症状。冬季则需防备冬瘟，此病多由外感寒邪引起，治疗时宜散寒化饮。若患者出现过期不产，亦可能与命门之火不足有关，此时需调和气血，以助分娩。怒则气上，情志不畅亦会影响脏腑功能，进而加重病情。||The pattern of summer heat consuming body fluids and qi is often seen in late summer and autumn, due to high temperatures leading to depletion of body fluids; if further affected by pathogenic cold, it can easily develop into the cold-induced blood stasis pattern, characterized by symptoms such as convulsions. In winter, one needs to guard against winter pestilence, a disease usually caused by external invasion of cold, and treatment should focus on dissipating cold and transforming retained fluids. If a patient experiences post-term pregnancy, it may also be related to insufficiency of the fire of the gate of life; at this time, regulating and harmonizing qi and blood is needed to assist delivery. Anger causes the qi to rise, and poor emotional flow can also affect the function of zang-fu organs, thereby exacerbating the condition.

在治疗络穴相关疾病时，我们需注重化和营，通过适当的针灸手法如大泻刺来调整气血平衡，避免病证用药禁忌。对于妊娠转胞等特殊病症，应谨慎使用药物，以免影响胎儿健康。中消患者需注意饮食调理，避免过食辛辣刺激之物。针对小儿惊厥，应结合小儿体质特点，采用温和疗法。而寒痰证患者则需温化寒痰，调和阴阳。||When treating diseases related to the Luo-connecting points, we should focus on transforming and harmonizing the Ying, adjusting the balance of Qi and Blood through appropriate acupuncture techniques such as Great Drainage Needling, and avoiding medicine contraindications for the disease pattern. For special conditions like Urine Retention in Pregnancy, drugs should be used with caution to avoid affecting fetal health. Patients with Wasting of the Middle Jiao need to pay attention to dietary adjustments and avoid excessive consumption of spicy and stimulating foods. For infantile convulsions, gentle therapies should be adopted in combination with the child's physical characteristics.

中医理论认为，人体内部环境与外界环境相互作用，导致各种疾病的发生。例如，喉癣虽非致命，但因其反复发作，严重影响患者生活质量，其根源在于血燥证，治疗时需注重调和肠胃剂的应用，以达到标本兼治的效果。又如足跟痹，虽看似局部病症，实则与肾垂功能失调密切相关，治疗时不可忽视既病防变的原则。此外，阴刺之症亦不可轻视，此症常由胃热气逆证引起，治疗上应以调理脾胃为主，同时兼顾清热解毒。通过综合分析病因病机，才能制定出更为有效的治疗方案。||According to TCM theory, the interaction between the internal environment of the human body and the external environment leads to the occurrence of various diseases. For example, although pharyngotuberculosis is not fatal, it can severely affect the quality of life of patients due to its recurrence; its root lies in the blood dryness pattern, and during treatment, it is necessary to focus on the application of formulas that regulate and harmonize the stomach and intestines to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and root. As for heel pain, although it appears as a local disease, it is actually closely related to kidney prolapse dysfunction; when treating, one must not ignore the principle of preventing transmission of a disease after its onset. Additionally, yin needling should not be taken lightly; this condition is often caused by the heat-induced ascending of stomach qi pattern, and treatment should mainly focus on regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach while also taking into account clearing heat and removing toxins. Only through comprehensive analysis of causative factors and pathogenesis can more effective treatment plans be formulated.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this might be due to the dysfunction of the dredging and draining organ. I advised him to pay attention to his dietary habits in daily life, avoiding excessive consumption of cold foods, because cold should be treated with warmth, and adjusting his constitution is fundamental. He also mentioned that sometimes he feels unwell, as if with the strength of four ounces one can move a thousand jin (a traditional Chinese unit of weight). I analyzed that it might be caused by the blood stasis pattern in the heart and liver, and suggested that he could appropriately engage in exercises that promote blood circulation. Additionally, he has been under great work pressure recently, often staying up late, leading to damage to thin body fluids, resulting in symptoms such as dry mouth and tongue, which exacerbate his condition, especially the appearance of lotus tongue, all of which need our attention.

中医认为，人体有八体之说，通过调和这些部位的功能，可以达到治疗疾病的目的。例如，在治疗肝气犯胃证时，我们采用化瘀生新的方法，促进气血运行，同时运用涤痰破结的手段，清除体内痰湿，使脾胃功能恢复正常。在某些情况下，血虚风燥证也会出现，此时需要滋养真阴，散寒燥湿，以恢复机体平衡。通过这些综合治疗方法，可以有效地改善患者的症状，提高生活质量。||In TCM, there is a theory of eight body parts, and by harmonizing the functions of these parts, the purpose of treating diseases can be achieved.

在探讨中医养生与治疗的过程中，我们常提及“太极拳流派”对于调和气血的重要性，它不仅有助于促进“气血两清剂”的流通，还能增强体质。“心血亏虚证”患者常伴有面色苍白、心悸等症状，通过练习特定的“太极拳流派”，结合服用具有补益心气功效的药物，可以有效改善症状。而“脾积痞气”则往往源于饮食不当，导致脾胃功能失调，出现腹胀、食欲不振等表现。值得注意的是，“下石疽”是一种较为严重的皮肤病，表现为局部红肿热痛，治疗时需辨证施治，避免使用过于温燥的药物。同时，保持良好的生活习惯，适当锻炼如练习“太极拳流派”，对预防此类疾病也大有裨益。对于“热证”患者，则应避免食用辛辣刺激性食物，以免加重病情。综上所述，通过合理的生活调理与适当的药物治疗，可以有效改善上述病症。||In the discussion of health preservation and treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine, we often mention the importance of "Taijiquan styles" in regulating and harmonizing qi and blood. It not only helps promote the circulation of "formulas that clear heat in the qi and blood," but also enhances physical fitness. Patients with the "heart blood deficiency pattern" often exhibit symptoms such as a pale facial complexion and palpitations. By practicing specific "Taijiquan styles" combined with taking medications that tonify heart qi, symptoms can be effectively improved. The "masses in the spleen" often originate from improper diet, leading to dysfunction of the spleen and stomach, manifesting as abdominal distension and loss of appetite. It is noteworthy that "lower hard nodules" is a relatively severe skin condition characterized by local redness, swelling, heat, and pain. During treatment, it is necessary to perform "pattern identification" and avoid using excessively warm-drying medications. At the same time, maintaining good living habits and engaging in appropriate exercise, such as practicing "Taijiquan styles," is greatly beneficial for preventing such diseases. For patients with the "heat pattern," they should avoid eating spicy and stimulating foods to prevent aggravating their condition. In summary, through reasonable lifestyle adjustments and appropriate medication treatments, the aforementioned conditions can be effectively improved.

Additionally, if the condition progresses further, it may lead to darkening of the skin, or even more severe conditions like lochia disturbing the heart mind. It is noteworthy that when dealing with such diseases, in addition to focusing on the dysfunction of internal organs, external factors such as pine caterpillar injuries should also be taken into consideration, as these can complicate the condition. For patients with dry eyes, a comprehensive analysis and treatment should also be conducted by taking all the aforementioned aspects into account.

在探讨大周天与针灸手法如捻转补泻的关系时，我们发现特定的针灸操作对于治疗风热表证和表证具有显著效果。进一步研究显示，对于妊娠期间出现的小便不通（即妊娠小便不通），采用合适的针刺位置和捻转补泻手法可以有效缓解症状。此外，在月经前后诸症的研究中，观察到某些特定的针灸策略对于改善嫩舌等体征有积极作用。然而，这些方法在治疗癃闭方面的作用仍需更多的临床数据支持。本研究旨在通过上述分析，为中医临床提供更全面的理论依据。||When exploring the relationship between the large heavenly circle and acupuncture techniques such as reinforcing and reducing by twirling, we found that specific acupuncture operations have significant effects on treating wind heat exterior pattern and exterior pattern. Further research shows that for urinary retention during pregnancy (i.e., urine retention in pregnancy), using appropriate acupuncture points and reinforcing and reducing by twirling techniques can effectively alleviate symptoms. Additionally, in the study of perimenstrual disorders, it was observed that certain specific acupuncture strategies have positive effects on improving signs such as tender tongue. However, the role of these methods in treating urinary retention still requires more clinical data support. This study aims to provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for TCM clinical practice through the above analysis.

在探讨中医治疗原则时，我们常提到“相须”这一概念，即两种功效相似或互补的药物配合使用以增强疗效。例如，在处理“心肺阴虚证”时，采用“滋阴清热”的方法可以有效改善症状。而对于“泄泻病”，中医主张“温下实寒”，通过温补来调整体内阴阳平衡。值得注意的是，“脾积气”是导致消化不良的重要因素之一，治疗时需注重调理脾胃。此外，“先天之本”指的是肾，肾功能的好坏直接影响人体健康，因此在治疗过程中也需加以重视。“清胃降火”和“温下实寒”则是在不同体质下常用的治疗方法，前者适用于胃火旺盛的情况，后者则针对体内寒湿过重的问题。综上所述，中医治疗不仅需要辨证施治，还要结合患者的具体情况，灵活运用各种治疗方法。||When discussing the principles of TCM treatment, we often mention the concept of "mutual reinforcement," where two drugs with similar or complementary effects are used together to enhance therapeutic efficacy. For instance, when dealing with the "heart and lung yin deficiency pattern," the method of "nourishing yin and clearing heat" can effectively improve symptoms. As for "diarrhea," TCM advocates "warm yang and dissipate cold," adjusting the body's yin-yang balance through warming and tonifying methods. It is noteworthy that "masses in the spleen" are one of the important factors leading to digestive disorders; during treatment, it is necessary to focus on regulating the spleen and stomach. Additionally, "innate foundation" refers to the kidney, and the quality of kidney function directly affects human health, so it must also be given due attention in the treatment process. "Clearing and reducing stomach heat" and "warm yang and dissipate cold" are commonly used treatment methods under different constitutions; the former is suitable for cases of excessive stomach fire, while the latter targets issues of excessive internal cold-dampness. In summary, TCM treatment not only requires pattern differentiation but also needs to combine the patient's specific conditions, flexibly applying various treatment methods.

在探讨肝热阴虚证时，我们发现平性药的应用对于调理体质具有独特效果。而在治疗厥病过程中，雁疮的识别与预防显得尤为重要。通过观察和研究十五络脉，我们可以更好地理解疾病的发生机制，并采用隔附子饼灸等外治法进行干预。此外，在某些情况下，使用逐水剂来调整体内水液代谢也是必要的，以达到主气调和的目的。这些方法共同构成了中医治疗复杂病症的重要组成部分。||In the discussion of liver heat with yin deficiency pattern, we found that the application of neutral-property medicines plays a unique role in regulating the constitution. During the treatment of syncope disorder, the identification and prevention of cat's eye-shaped sore are particularly important. By observing and studying the fifteen collaterals, we can better understand the mechanism of disease occurrence and adopt external therapies such as monkshood cake-insulated moxibustion for intervention. Additionally, in certain cases, it is necessary to use formulas that expel water to adjust the metabolism of thick body fluids within the body to achieve the purpose of harmonizing host qi. These methods collectively form an essential part of TCM treatments for complex diseases.

最近我遇到一位患者，他长期受冷凝肩困扰，行动不便，还伴有脱壳乳痈的症状，看起来像是中气不足导致的。我建议他平时多吃些能滋补脾阴的食物，同时配合一些运动来改善中气虚弱的情况。另外他的肘劲也不太好，走路时有些不便。我还发现他的皮肤上有一些热毒蕴肤证的表现，可能是体内湿气过重，需要好好调理。平时可以多做一些利耳的动作，帮助身体排毒。希望这些方法能够帮到他，也提醒大家注意日常保健，避免类似问题的发生。||Recently, I encountered a patient who has been suffering from cold凝聚shoulder for a long time, experiencing difficulty in movement, and also showing symptoms of脱壳mastitis, which appears to be caused by insufficient central Qi. I recommended that he eat more foods that can nourish and supplement spleen yin on a regular basis, while also combining some exercises to improve the condition of Qi deficiency. Additionally, his elbow striking power is not very good, causing inconvenience when walking. I also noticed some manifestations of retained heat toxin in the skin pattern on his skin, possibly due to excessive dampness inside the body, requiring proper regulation. He can do more actions to unblock the ears to help the body detoxify. I hope these methods can be helpful to him and remind everyone to pay attention to daily health care to avoid similar problems from occurring.

在探讨气阴亏虚证与落枕的关系时，我们发现运用验方结合佐助药治疗可以达到较好的疗效。同时，在日常保健中，通过练习太极拳拳理，不仅可以强身健体，还能预防因气阴不足引发的摇头及落枕等症状。对于已经出现的病症如落枕和摇头，采用标本同治的方法，从根源上解决瘕病的发生，提高患者的生活质量。||In exploring the relationship between the Qi and Yin deficiency pattern and neck stiffness, we found that using empirical formulas combined with facilitating assistant medicines can achieve good therapeutic effects. Meanwhile, in daily health maintenance, practicing Taijiquan principles not only strengthens the body but also prevents symptoms such as head shaking and neck stiffness caused by insufficient Qi and Yin. For existing diseases like neck stiffness and head shaking, adopting a method to treat both the tip and root can solve the problem of intangible masses at its source, thereby improving the patient's quality of life.

药膳在中医中不仅用于治疗疾病，还能够调理身体，比如针对妊娠偏头痛，通过合理的食疗可以有效缓解症状。然而，在临床实践中，我们发现某些疾病的治疗需要遵循逆治法，如对于足太阳膀胱经证引起的汗类病，逆治法的应用显得尤为重要。另外，阳黄病与饥疝也是常见的病症，它们可能由劳逸失度过大引起，需要通过综合调理来改善。||Medicated diets in Traditional Chinese Medicine are not only used for treating diseases but can also regulate the body. For example, for migraines during pregnancy, proper food therapy can effectively alleviate symptoms. However, in clinical practice, we have found that the treatment of certain diseases requires the application of routine treatment methods; for instance, for sweating disorders caused by the Bladder meridian pattern, the use of routine treatment is particularly important. Additionally, Yang jaundice and hunger-related abdominal pain are common conditions that may be caused by work-rest imbalance and require comprehensive regulation to improve.

通过对《太极枪》的研究，我们发现其中蕴含的“掤劲”不仅是一种武术技巧，还与“脾肾气虚不固证”的治疗有着密切联系。临床观察显示，患者在治疗过程中，若出现“脏毒”症状，往往伴有“目眩”，同时，“产后恶露不绝”也可能与此有关。此外，在夏季高温环境下，人体易受“中暑”影响，导致上述症状加重，尤其是在“精室”功能失调的情况下。因此，结合《太极枪》中的理论指导，对于上述症状的综合调理具有重要的临床意义。||Through the study of "Taiji Spear", we found that the "Peng" ward off contained within is not only a martial arts skill, but also closely related to the treatment of the "pattern of spleen and kidney qi deficiency". Clinical observations show that patients during the treatment process, if they exhibit symptoms of "anal abscess", often accompany with "blurred vision", while "persistent lochia discharge" may also be related. Additionally, in high summer temperatures, the human body is prone to "summer heat stroke", exacerbating the above symptoms, especially when there is dysfunction in the "essence chamber". Therefore, combining the theoretical guidance of "Taiji Spear", comprehensive regulation for the above symptoms has important clinical significance.

在探讨肝郁脾虚证与寒滞胃肠证的临床表现时，我们发现两者常相互影响。通过输刺（五刺）等治疗方法，可以有效调整阴阳，促进本气恢复。对于风寒湿痹的患者，若治疗不当易转化为新感温病，此时需重视调整机体状态，防止出现回光返照现象，确保治疗方案的合理性和有效性。||In exploring the clinical manifestations of the pattern of liver hyperactivity with spleen deficiency and cold retention in the stomach and intestines, we find that they often influence each other. Through Shu needling (one of the five needling techniques), Yin-Yang can be effectively regulated to promote the recovery of root qi.

在探讨热闭心包证与心阴亏虚证的区别时，我们发现两者虽同属心脏病变范畴，但其病理机制迥异。热闭心包证多由外感温热邪毒内陷心包所致，临床可见高热神昏等症状；而心阴亏虚证则多因劳心过度或久病不愈，导致心阴亏损，常见心悸失眠等症。治疗上，热闭心包证宜清热开窍，常用线剂如安宫牛黄丸；心阴亏虚证则需滋阴养心，可用天王补心丹等。此外，在针灸治疗方面，选取八脉交会穴如内关、公孙等穴位进行意气运动，可有效调节阴阳平衡。临床上还应注意辨别吞酸与阴黄病，前者多由肝胃不和引起，后者则属脾肾阳虚之象。对于肾气不固证患者，需重视固涩肾气，防止病情进一步发展。通过上述分析，我们可以更好地理解这些病症之间的联系与区别，从而为临床诊疗提供更为精准的指导。||In exploring the differences between the syndrome of Heat Blocking the Pericardium and Heart Yin Deficiency, we find that although both belong to the category of cardiac lesions, their pathological mechanisms are distinct. The syndrome of Heat Blocking the Pericardium is often caused by external invasion of warm-heat pathogenic factors affecting the Pericardium, clinically manifesting symptoms such as high fever and loss of consciousness; whereas Heart Yin Deficiency is mostly due to overwork of the heart or prolonged illness leading to depletion of Heart yin, commonly presenting symptoms like palpitations and insomnia. In treatment, for the syndrome of Heat Blocking the Pericardium, clearing heat and opening the orifices is recommended, often using medicated threads such as An Gong Niu Huang Wan; for Heart Yin Deficiency, nourishing yin and tonifying the heart is necessary, and Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan can be used. Additionally, in acupuncture therapy, selecting eight confluent points such as Nei Guan and Gong Sun for intent-qi movement can effectively regulate the balance of Yin and Yang. Clinically, it is also important to differentiate acid regurgitation from Yin jaundice, the former often caused by disharmony between liver and stomach, the latter indicating spleen-kidney yang deficiency. For patients with Kidney Qi Insecurity, emphasis should be placed on consolidating kidney qi to prevent further progression of the condition. Through the above analysis, we can better understand the relationships and distinctions among these syndromes, thereby providing more precise guidance for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

I initially judged that he is showing symptoms of the pattern of heat blazing in both qi and blood phases, which requires timely regulation. At the same time, his cough belongs to the category of cough due to internal dysfunctions, and it is suggested to try the method of releasing the exterior and dispersing the lung to help alleviate the symptoms. Additionally, he mentioned frequently experiencing tinnitus, which may be related to the lung's function of regulating waterways, so attention should be paid to lung health. Moreover, his body type tends to be overweight, and his irregular diet might lead to the situation of spleen deficiency with phlegm obstructing the lung, at this point, the handle-scraping method can be used to promote blood circulation and improve the problem of phlegm obstructing the lung.

菜乌紫病的发生与燥淫证密切相关，而燥淫证往往因风邪犯表证引发。在治疗过程中，我们常采用偶刺法来缓解病症，而对于更为严重的疠风，需要结合阴阳转化的理论进行综合治疗。在临床实践中，对于鼠乳等皮肤病变，也需注意其可能转化为更复杂的病状。通过上述方法，可以有效控制病情发展，帮助患者恢复健康。||The occurrence of Pickles cyanosis is closely related to the Pathogenic dryness pattern, which is often caused by the Wind attacking the exterior pattern. In the treatment process, we commonly use Coupled needling to alleviate the symptoms.

在探讨固肾安胎与肝脾不和证之关联时，我们发现乳痨患者中亦可见虫兽咬伤病引发之悬痈症状，其病机关键在于阴虚则热，导致脉络受损。临床观察表明，此类患者舌象常表现为有根苔，且伴有涩味，此乃气血不畅、津液亏损之象。因此，在治疗上需兼顾调理肝脾、固护肾气，以期达到阴平阳秘之效。||In exploring the correlation between reinforcing the kidney and securing the fetus and disharmony between the liver and spleen, we found that patients with breast tuberculosis may also exhibit symptoms of perineal abscess caused by insect or animal bites. The key pathogenesis lies in yin deficiency leading to heat, which results in damage to the vessels. Clinical observations show that such patients often present with rooted coating on their tongues, accompanied by an astringent flavor, indicating poor circulation of qi and blood and depletion of body fluids. Therefore, in treatment, it is necessary to regulate and harmonize the liver and spleen while reinforcing kidney qi, aiming for a balance between yin and yang.

在日常生活中，我们经常会遇到一些看似普通的症状，比如风眩带来的头晕目眩，或是胸痹心痛时的心痛彻背。这些症状往往与我们的气血运行不畅有关。记得有一次，一位朋友因为饮食不当导致了食复，加重了原本就有的血虚肠结证。我建议他采用辛寒清热的方法调理，同时注意补气摄乳，增强体质。另外，对于那些经常感到半表半里证不适的人，日常生活中也要特别注意饮食和情绪调节，避免病情反复。通过合理的饮食和生活习惯调整，很多常见病症都可以得到缓解。||In daily life, we often encounter some seemingly ordinary symptoms, such as the dizziness caused by wind dizziness or the chest pain radiating to the back during chest bi-impediment/cardiac pain. These symptoms are usually related to the stagnation of Qi and Blood circulation. Once, a friend experienced recurrence due to improper diet, exacerbating the pre-existing pattern of intestinal dryness due to blood deficiency. I recommended he adjust his condition by clearing heat with pungent cold while also tonifying Qi and astringing the breast milk to strengthen his physique. Additionally, for those who frequently feel neither exterior nor interior pattern discomfort, it is particularly important in daily life to pay attention to dietary and emotional regulation to avoid recurrent episodes of illness. By making reasonable adjustments to diet and lifestyle, many common symptoms can be alleviated.

最近有位朋友跟我分享了他的困扰，说是手臂上起了几个小疙瘩，痒得厉害，他说可能是漆毒作祟，我建议他先避免接触可能引起过敏的物质，并且可以试试用些清热解毒的草药。另外他还说有时候会感觉腹部不适，特别是饭后，我猜可能是中焦热盛证，提醒他饮食要清淡一些，多吃蔬菜水果，少吃油腻辛辣的食物。他还提到自己平时喜欢打太极拳，说是练拳时感觉身心舒畅，尤其是那个拳势，动作柔和缓慢，有助于调理肝主疏泄的功能，促进气血畅通。不过他也提到了自己的情绪有时会比较烦躁，我猜测可能是相火妄动，建议他可以通过冥想、静坐等方式来平复心情。最后，他提到颈部有个小肿块，不痛不痒，但担心是瘰疬或子岩，我建议他及时就医，通过专业手段确诊并治疗。希望我的一些建议对他有所帮助。||Recently, a friend shared with me his concerns, saying that he had developed several small papules on his arm which were extremely itchy. He mentioned that it might be lacquer dermatitis causing this, so I advised him to avoid contact with substances that could cause allergies and suggested he try using some folk medicines for clearing heat and removing toxins. Additionally, he mentioned that sometimes he felt discomfort in his abdomen, especially after meals. I guessed it might be due to middle jiao heat exuberance syndrome and reminded him to eat more lightly, consume more vegetables and fruits, and reduce the intake of greasy and spicy foods. He also mentioned that he enjoys practicing Taijiquan, saying that when he practices, he feels mentally and physically comfortable, particularly because the Taijiquan structure involves gentle and slow movements, which can help regulate the function of the liver governing the free flow of qi, promoting the smooth flow of qi and blood. However, he also mentioned that his emotions can sometimes become restless, and I speculated it might be due to the reckless stirring of ministerial fire, suggesting that he could calm his mind through meditation and sitting quietly. Finally, he mentioned that there was a small swelling in his neck, painless and itchy, but he was worried it might be scrofula or testicular cancer. I advised him to seek medical attention promptly to obtain professional diagnosis and treatment. I hope my suggestions will be helpful to him.

在日常生活中，我们可以通过食补来调养身体，比如多吃一些能敛汗固表的食物，帮助我们更好地应对季节变化。最近我发现自己总是莫名感到疲惫，有时候还会出现相火妄动的情况，中医认为这可能是情志不畅导致的，比如过度担忧会克制内心的喜悦（恐胜喜）。我决定通过调理饮食来改善这种情况，选择了一些能够调和气血的食物，并且按照医嘱服用了一些水丸来辅助治疗。此外，我还注意观察自己的身体状况，避免过度劳累，因为我知道过度劳累可能会加重太阳腑证的症状。希望这些小小的调整能够帮助我恢复健康，摆脱阴茧般的束缚感。||In daily life, we can nourish the body through dietary therapy, such as eating more foods that can astringe sweating and secure the exterior to help us better adapt to seasonal changes. Recently, I found myself feeling inexplicably fatigued, and sometimes experiencing reckless stirring of the ministerial fire. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes this might be due to emotional stagnation, for example, excessive worry may restrain inner joy (fear prevails over excess joy). I decided to improve this situation by regulating my diet, choosing some foods that can regulate and harmonize qi and blood, and taking water pills as per medical advice to assist in treatment. Additionally, I pay attention to observing my physical condition, avoiding overwork, because I know that overwork may exacerbate symptoms of the Taiyang-fu organ pattern.

If the patient exhibits wagging tongue symptoms, it indicates that the disease has reached the life pass, and timely treatment is required. During diagnosis, we should carefully observe the abnormal pulses to determine the depth of the disease. If lung abscess has formed, then coughing up pus and blood will occur, indicating a critical condition; liver qi affecting the spleen pattern is manifested as abdominal distension and poor appetite, with dyspepsia.

At the same time, I considered whether it might be due to the liver heat with blood stagnation pattern; of course, if the situation is complex, there may also be the pathogenic factors hidden in the pleurodiaphragmatic interspace pattern, requiring comprehensive regulation. Additionally, he also has a problem with smelly armpit, which could be caused by excessive internal damp-heat and disharmony between the liver and gallbladder, so I recommended several folk medicines for clearing heat and removing dampness. By the way, he was once troubled by gallbladder distention, but fortunately, the symptoms have now eased considerably. Lastly, I remind everyone to pay attention to hand hygiene in daily life to avoid conditions like snake head-like whitlow.

在探讨弦脉与反关脉的临床意义时，我们发现两者在诊断胃痛与脾约等病症中有独特价值。通过炒法炮制草药，可以更好地发挥其辟秽通窍之效，尤其适用于开窍法治疗因外感秽浊之气导致的胃痛。同时，肾精的充足与否也直接影响脾胃功能，肾精不足则易出现脾约症状。综上所述，合理运用这些理论与方法，对于提升临床疗效具有重要意义。||When exploring the clinical significance of wiry pulse and pulse on the back of the wrist, we found that both have unique values in diagnosing diseases such as stomach ache and splenic constipation. Through stir-frying, the medicinal effects of folk medicines for repelling foulness and opening the orifices can be better utilized, especially suitable for orifice-opening methods to treat stomach ache caused by external invasion of foul turbidity. At the same time, the abundance or deficiency of Kidney essence directly affects the function of spleen and stomach; if Kidney essence is insufficient, symptoms of splenic constipation are likely to occur. In summary, reasonably applying these theories and methods is of great significance for improving clinical efficacy.

在探讨妊娠期间的复杂病症时，我们注意到“妊娠腹痛”与“子肿”的临床表现及其潜在机制。对于妊娠期出现“饥不欲食”的症状，我们需谨慎处理，以避免不当治疗对母体及胎儿造成不良影响。同时，“妊娠用药禁忌”是必须严格遵守的原则，尤其是在采用“涌吐开关”等疗法时。值得注意的是，文献中偶见提及“花痴”一症，此症虽非妊娠特有，但在妊娠期间尤需重视。此外，针对某些特定情况，如“虚阳浮越证”，可能需要采取“短刺”等特殊治疗方法来调节体内阴阳平衡，从而达到治疗目的。综上所述，在处理妊娠期疾病时，需全面考虑上述各种因素，以确保母婴安全。||In discussing complex diseases during pregnancy, we have noted the clinical manifestations and underlying mechanisms of "abdominal pain in pregnancy" and "oedema during pregnancy". For symptoms of "hungry but with no appetite" appearing during pregnancy, we must handle them with caution to avoid adverse effects on the mother and fetus due to improper treatment. At the same time, "contraindicated medicines during pregnancy" is a principle that must be strictly adhered to, especially when employing therapies such as "induce vomiting to refresh the mind". It is noteworthy that literature occasionally mentions "sexual obsessions", a condition not unique to pregnancy but requiring particular attention during this period. Additionally, for certain specific conditions, such as the "floating of deficiency yang pattern", special therapeutic methods like "short needling" may be required to regulate the body's yin-yang balance, thereby achieving the therapeutic goal. In summary, when dealing with diseases during pregnancy, all of these factors should be comprehensively considered to ensure the safety of both mother and child.

最近有位朋友因为长期饮食不规律导致气血失调，时常感到疲乏无力，甚至出现了气脱证的症状，整个人精神状态非常差。我建议他采用汤剂的方式服用一些补益心肺的中药来调理，同时辅以益气固脱的方法，帮助身体恢复元气。另外，如果孩子的体质偏弱，容易出现疳证，那么在日常生活中就要特别注意观察孩子手指上的风关，以便及时发现并处理问题。通过这些方法，希望能够帮助大家更好地理解和应对这些问题。||Recently, a friend of mine suffered from Qi-blood disharmony due to long-term irregular diet, often feeling fatigued and weak, and even exhibiting symptoms of Qi collapse pattern, with very poor mental state. I suggested he take Chinese medicines in the form of decoctions to tonify the heart and lung, while also adopting methods to supplement qi to prevent collapse, to help restore his Yuan-primordial qi. Additionally, if a child's constitution is weak and prone to malnutrition pattern, it is particularly important to pay close attention to observing the Wind pass on the child's fingers in daily life, so as to detect and address issues in time. Through these methods, I hope to help everyone better understand and cope with these problems.

最近在跟一位朋友聊天时发现他总是感到胸闷气短，怀疑是气滞痰阻证，提醒他平时要注意饮食，少吃油腻食物，多吃一些清肺润燥的食物。另外他还经常感觉小便黄赤，可能是膀胱积热证，建议他多喝水，适当运动。我告诉他要保持心情舒畅，避免情绪波动，因为这可能会加重病情。此外，他的舌苔有些厚腻，呈现霉酱苔的状态，这也可能是体内湿气过重的表现。如果情况没有改善，最好去医院检查一下，看看是否还有心水病。在日常生活中，我们可以用长针进行简单的自我按摩，帮助分消走泄体内的湿气，同时也要注意作息规律，保证充足的睡眠，让身体阴阳平衡，尤其是要让阳中之阴得到充分休息。||Recently, while chatting with a friend, I found that he often feels chest stuffiness and shortness of breath, suspecting it to be Qi stagnation with phlegm retention pattern, and advised him to pay attention to his diet, eating less greasy food and more food that can clear lung heat and moisten dryness. Additionally, he frequently experiences yellow, reddish urine, which might indicate heat accumulating in the urinary bladder pattern; I suggested that he drink more water and engage in appropriate physical exercise. I told him to maintain a pleasant mood and avoid emotional fluctuations, as this could worsen his condition. Furthermore, his tongue coating is somewhat thick and greasy, showing a state of rotten-curdy coating, which may also be a sign of excessive dampness inside the body. If there's no improvement, it would be best for him to go to the hospital for a check-up to see if he has congestive heart failure. In daily life, we can use long needles for simple self-massage to help induce urination and promote bowel movements to eliminate dampness from the body, while also paying attention to regular作息 and ensuring adequate sleep, maintaining the balance of Yin and Yang in the body, especially allowing Yin within Yang to rest sufficiently.

在夏季，人们常因高温而出现身体不适，此时应注重扶脾化湿，祛暑利湿，以保持体内阴阳平衡。采用揉捏法按摩穴位，有助于温阳理气，缓解因天气炎热引起的灼痛感。治疗过程中，应根据季节变化因时制宜，同时注意虚实分明，区分不同体质采取相应措施。对于儿童常见的坐板疮问题，通过上述方法调理，可以有效促进康复。在此基础上，结合适当的饮食和生活习惯调整，能够更好地维护健康。||In summer, people often experience physical discomfort due to high temperatures; at this time, it is important to focus on tonifying the spleen and transforming dampness, dispelling summer heat and promoting diuresis to maintain the body's yin-yang balance. Using kneading-pinching manipulation for acupoint massage can help warm yang and circulate qi, alleviating the burning pain caused by hot weather. During treatment, one should adjust treatment methods according to seasonal changes, while also paying attention to distinguishing between deficiency and excess, and adopting corresponding measures based on different constitutions.

最近在看一些关于火热炽盛证的文章，发现很多人对于这种病症还是不太了解。其实，我们在日常生活中可以通过一些辛凉解表剂来缓解症状，比如菊花茶等。同时，如果体质虚弱的话，益气解表的方法也能帮助改善。说到体质，我想到的是肾精的重要性，毕竟肾精充足才能保持身体活力。记得有一次遇到一个病人，面色呈现真脏色，这通常意味着病情比较严重。我还记得他穿了一条尖裆裤，这个细节让我印象深刻。另外，水肿类病也是我经常遇到的问题，很多患者因为饮食不当导致水肿。通过指切进针法治疗后，他们的症状都有所缓解。希望这些知识能对大家有所帮助。||Recently, I have read some articles about the Fire Toxic Pattern, and found that many people still do not fully understand this syndrome. In fact, in our daily lives, we can alleviate symptoms through some formulas that release the exterior with pungent-cool properties, such as chrysanthemum tea. At the same time, if one's constitution is weak, the method of supplementing qi and releasing the exterior can also help improve the condition. Speaking of constitution, I think of the importance of Kidney essence; after all, only when the Kidney essence is abundant can one maintain vitality. I remember once encountering a patient whose complexion showed the true colors of the five zang organs, which usually indicates a relatively severe condition. I still recall he was wearing a pair of sharp-angled crotch pants, a detail that left a deep impression on me. In addition, oedema disorders are also a common problem I frequently encounter; many patients develop edema due to improper diet. After treatment with the nail-pressing insertion technique, their symptoms were alleviated. I hope these pieces of knowledge will be helpful to everyone.

大家好，最近在研究中医古籍时发现了一种叫做“寸白虫病”的病症，据说是因为饮食不当导致体内寄生虫滋生。治疗这种疾病时，我们需要注意药材的“修制”，确保药物纯净有效。另外，如果出现“伪膜”现象，可能是病情加重的表现。在日常生活中，我们要避免“不内外因”引起的疾病，比如过度劳累或情绪波动。记得有位朋友曾提到过“劳疟”，这其实是由于长期劳作而引发的疟疾。还有，“关格”是中医术语，指的是上下不通的情况，如果严重到“脚气冲心”，那就需要及时就医了。最后，“迎随补泻”是一种针灸手法，有助于调和人体阴阳平衡。希望这些知识能帮助大家更好地了解中医，保持健康。||Hello everyone, recently while studying ancient Chinese medical texts, I discovered a condition called "Taeniasis" which is said to be caused by improper diet leading to the proliferation of parasites within the body. When treating this disease, we need to pay attention to the "medicinal processing" of the herbs to ensure their purity and effectiveness. Additionally, if a "pseudomembrane" phenomenon appears, it may indicate that the condition has worsened. In daily life, we should avoid diseases caused by "neither internal nor external etiological factors", such as overwork or emotional fluctuations. I remember a friend once mentioned "chronic malaria", which is actually a type of malaria triggered by prolonged labor. Furthermore, "urinary block and vomiting" is a term in Traditional Chinese Medicine referring to a situation where there is an obstruction in both upper and lower parts of the body; if it becomes severe to the point of causing "cardiac beriberi", immediate medical attention is required. Lastly, "directional tonifying and sedating" is a type of acupuncture technique that helps to harmonize the body's yin and yang balance. It is hoped that these pieces of knowledge can help everyone better understand Traditional Chinese Medicine and maintain health.

最近有朋友问我关于调理气血的问题，其实生活中我们经常会遇到一些小毛病，比如混合痔这样的问题，有时候饮食不当或者劳累过度就会出现，这时候我们可以用一些活血行气的方法来缓解，同时对于那些因为暴痢导致身体虚弱的情况，我们也可以采用类似的方法来调理。当然，如果是因为瘿劳或者其他精气不足引起的身体不适，我们就需要更加全面地调整生活习惯，包括饮食和作息，甚至可以尝试一些驱虫法来清除体内的寄生虫，以达到镇痉熄风的效果，从而更好地恢复健康。||Recently, a friend asked me about regulating and harmonizing qi and blood. In fact, in our daily lives, we often encounter some minor ailments, such as mixed hemorrhoids. Sometimes, improper diet or overwork can lead to these issues. At this time, we can use methods to circulate blood and resolve stagnation to alleviate them. Meanwhile, for those whose bodies are weakened due to damp heat dysentery, we can also adopt similar methods to regulate and harmonize qi and blood. Of course, if the discomfort is caused by hypothyroidism or other deficiencies of essence qi, we need to make more comprehensive adjustments to our lifestyle habits, including diet and sleep patterns.

在探讨三因学说时，我们注意到环境因素、体质因素及情志因素对疾病的影响。针对夏季热病，采用清暑解毒法以缓解症状，同时需重视后天之气的调养，确保脾胃功能正常。对于寒实结胸证，运用温通散结法治疗；而脉痹与风痹则分别由寒邪与风邪引起，需辨证施治。临床观察显示，患者常伴有纳少现象，此为脾胃虚弱之征象，需结合五化理论进行综合调理。通过上述分析可见，中医辨证论治的重要性在于全面把握病因病机，以达到精准治疗的目的。||In discussing the theory of three etiological categories, we observe the influence of environmental factors, constitutional factors, and emotional factors on diseases. For summer heat diseases, the method of clearing summer heat and removing toxins is employed to alleviate symptoms, while also emphasizing the nurturing of acquired qi to ensure normal spleen and stomach functions. For the pattern of retained excess cold in the chest, the treatment method of warming and dispersing nodules is applied; while vessel impediment and wind impediment are respectively caused by cold pathogenic factors and wind pathogenic factors, requiring syndrome differentiation-based treatment. Clinical observations show that patients often exhibit poor appetite, which is a sign of spleen and stomach weakness, and should be adjusted comprehensively according to the Five Transformations theory. Through the above analysis, it can be seen that the importance of treatment based on syndrome differentiation in Traditional Chinese Medicine lies in fully grasping the causative factors and pathogenesis to achieve precise treatment.

Additionally, attention should be paid to emotional regulation in daily life, avoiding overwork to prevent issues with tonifying Qi and calming the mind. For some friends with more severe conditions, methods such as transforming stasis and harmonizing the stomach or sequential meridian transmission could be considered for treatment. Of course, specific treatment methods should be determined based on individual circumstances, and one must not blindly take medication on their own.

中医认为人体健康与自然环境息息相关，其中《素问》提到“生之本，本于阴阳”，说明了阴阳平衡对人体健康的重要性。在治疗一些疾病时，如出现“胸胁苦满”等症状，我们常采用“清心泻脾”的方法来调整体内阴阳平衡。对于一些痉挛症状，比如“角弓反张”，则需通过“熄风定痉”来缓解。而关于“宗筋”和“皮痹”的问题，中医理论指出，这些病症的发生往往与气血运行不畅有关，治疗时不仅要调理气血，还需注意饮食习惯，避免“🗎性黏滞”食物加重病情。总之，中医治疗强调辨证施治，综合调理，以达到最佳疗效。||TCM considers that human health is closely related to the natural environment, where "The foundation of life lies in yin and yang," as mentioned in The Plain Questions, illustrating the importance of yin-yang balance to health. When treating certain diseases, such as symptoms like "fullness in the chest and sub-costal region," we often adopt the method of "clearing heat in the heart and spleen" to adjust the body's yin-yang balance. For some spasm symptoms, such as "opisthotonus," it is necessary to alleviate them through "stop wind and relieve convulsions." Regarding issues like "gathering of muscle around the genital region" and "skin impediment," TCM theory points out that these conditions often occur due to poor circulation of qi and blood. During treatment, it is not only necessary to regulate and harmonize qi and blood but also pay attention to dietary habits and avoid "dampness is sticky and stagnant" foods that may exacerbate the condition. In summary, TCM emphasizes syndrome differentiation and individualized treatment, comprehensive regulation, to achieve the best therapeutic effect.

交肠病与皮肤瘙痒困扰着许多人，其中交肠病常常伴随牙疳出现。治疗时，我们常采用扶正解表剂来疏风透疹，同时使用具有散寒开窍作用的药物以缓解症状。在某些情况下，肝气犯胃证也会并发，此时需结合膏肓穴进行针灸治疗以调和气血，达到散寒开窍的效果。通过综合治疗，可以有效改善这些复杂的病症。||Obstetric (rectovaginal) fistula and skin itch affect many people, often accompanied by ulcerative gingivitis. In treatment, we commonly use formulas that reinforce healthy qi and release the exterior to remove wind and promote skin eruption, while using drugs with actions to dissipate cold and open the orifices to alleviate symptoms. In some cases, the pattern of Qi stagnation of the liver and stomach may also occur, requiring combined needling manipulation at the Gaohuang point to regulate and harmonize qi and blood, achieving the effect of dissipating cold and opening the orifices. Through comprehensive treatment, these complex conditions can be effectively improved.

在中医理论中，心系证类涵盖了多种心脏相关疾病，如心悸、怔忡等。而产后血晕则是指女性生产后出现的一种危急症状，表现为头晕眼花、面色苍白等。另一方面，颤动舌与肾着也常被提及，前者多见于神经系统疾病，后者则与肾脏功能失调有关。此外，飧泄作为一种消化系统疾病，其特征为大便稀薄且次数增多。值得注意的是，子岩是一种较为罕见的病症，通常表现为腹部肿块。风弦赤烂则主要影响眼部健康，表现为眼红、痒等症状。这些病症虽然各有特点，但通过中医的辨证施治，均能找到相应的治疗方法。||In TCM theory, the patterns of the heart system encompass various heart-related diseases such as palpitations and怔忡. Postpartum fainting refers to a critical symptom that occurs in women after childbirth, characterized by dizziness, blurred vision, and pale facial complexion. On the other hand, trembling tongue and lower back pain due to cold dampness are often mentioned; the former is frequently seen in nervous system diseases, while the latter is associated with dysfunction of the kidney. Moreover, diarrhea with undigested food, as a digestive system disease, is characterized by loose stools and increased frequency. It should be noted that testicular cancer is a relatively rare condition, typically manifesting as an abdominal mass. Red, wet, and ulcerative eyelid mainly affects eye health, presenting symptoms like redness and itching. Although these conditions each have their own characteristics, through TCM pattern differentiation, corresponding treatment methods can be found.

最近有朋友问我关于身体不适的问题，他说他总是感觉乏力，腰膝酸软，舌苔灰白，可能是肾虚寒证的表现。我建议他可以试试调整生活习惯，饮食清淡，避免过度劳累。另外，如果遇到蜂螫伤也不要慌张，可以用一些解毒药物处理。在日常生活中，我们也要注意保护好自己的阳脉之海——也就是我们的经络系统，这样才能让气血畅通。对于虚中夹实的情况，我们可以采用泄热开窍的方法来调理。还有，记得穿宽松的衣服，特别是裤子要选择圆裆的设计，这样可以减少对身体的压迫。最后，对于皮肤上出现的胶瘤，不要轻易挤压，应该及时就医治疗。||Recently, a friend asked me about his physical discomfort. He said he always feels lassitude, soreness in the waist and knees, and has grayish-white tongue coating, which may be the manifestation of a deficiency cold pattern. I suggested that he could try adjusting his lifestyle, eating light food, and avoiding overwork. Additionally, if he encounters bee/wasp stings, he should not panic but use some detoxifying drugs for treatment. In daily life, we must also pay attention to protecting our meridians and collaterals, which is like the sea of yang vessels, so as to ensure smooth flow of Qi and Blood. For cases of deficiency complicated with excess, we can regulate by clearing heat and opening the orifices. Also, remember to wear loose clothing, especially choose pants with round crotch design to reduce pressure on the body. Finally, for joint tumors appearing on the skin, do not squeeze them easily; seek medical treatment promptly.

暑瘟病与暑病在临床表现上存在诸多相似之处，但其本质在于精气亏虚证与命门之火不足，导致机体出现一系列寒热错杂症状。针对此类病症，我们采用利尿开窍法以促进传化功能，同时结合温阳益气治疗命门之火不足，有效缓解了患者的热淋症状。此外，在处理冻僵患者时，亦需重视暑瘟病与热淋之间的关联，综合运用上述方法，方能取得较好疗效。通过本研究，我们进一步明确了暑瘟病与精气亏虚证、热淋等症之间的内在联系，为临床诊治提供了新的思路。||The clinical manifestations of summer heat pestilence and summer-heat disorder share many similarities, but their essence lies in the essence and qi deficiency pattern and insufficiency of the fire of the gate of life, leading to a series of mixed cold and hot symptoms. For such conditions, we adopt orifice-opening methods to promote transmission and transformation functions, while simultaneously combining yang tonification and qi supplementation to treat the insufficiency of the fire of the gate of life, effectively alleviating the patient's heat strangury symptoms. Additionally, when dealing with patients suffering from systemic hypothermia, it is also necessary to pay attention to the relationship between summer heat pestilence and heat strangury, and comprehensively apply the aforementioned methods to achieve better therapeutic outcomes. Through this study, we have further clarified the intrinsic connections between summer heat pestilence, essence and qi deficiency pattern, heat strangury, and other syndromes, providing new ideas for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

在探讨斑痧与药疹的鉴别诊断时，我们注意到两者虽均表现为皮肤异常，但斑痧多由外感时邪引起，而药疹则主要因药物反应所致。对于斑痧患者的治疗，需重视其舌象变化，尤其是假苔的观察，以判断病情进展及预后。此外，在脉诊方面，结脉常提示病程较长，病情较为复杂。针对此类病症，临床实践中应灵活运用和法，如散寒开闭、和络等方法，以达到调和阴阳、缓解症状的目的。特别值得注意的是，冬瘟作为一种季节性流行病，其防治策略亦应包括上述原则，尤其在冬季应加强预防措施，避免疾病传播。通过综合运用以上治法，可有效改善患者症状，提高临床疗效。||In discussing the differential diagnosis between dry cholera and drug-induced dermatitis, we note that although both conditions manifest as skin abnormalities, dry cholera is often caused by invasion of seasonal pathogenic factors, whereas drug-induced dermatitis is primarily due to drug reactions. For patients with dry cholera, it is crucial to pay attention to changes in tongue manifestations, especially the observation of false coating, to assess the progression of the disease and prognosis. Additionally, in pulse diagnosis, a knotted pulse often indicates a longer course of the disease and a more complex condition. In clinical practice, the harmonizing method should be flexibly applied, such as dispersing cold to open closure and unblocking meridians, aiming to achieve the purpose of harmonizing yin and yang and alleviating symptoms. It is particularly noteworthy that winter pestilence, as a seasonal epidemic, should also include the aforementioned principles in its prevention and treatment strategies, especially strengthening preventive measures in winter to prevent the spread of the disease. By comprehensively applying these therapeutic methods, patient symptoms can be effectively improved, enhancing clinical efficacy.

在探讨经络之气与人体健康的关系时，我们不能忽视关门不利所导致的液代谢障碍，这常常引发五刺现象。隐痛作为常见症状之一，往往提示着脉痿的存在，而热蕴结证则是其背后的重要病理机制。阳脉之海的通畅与否直接影响到气血运行，进而影响身体各部位的功能状态。||When discussing the relationship between the Qi of meridians and human health, we cannot ignore the disorder of fluid metabolism caused by the water gate failing to operate, which often triggers the five needling techniques phenomenon. Dull pain as a common symptom usually indicates the existence of heart vessel flaccidity, while heat accumulation syndrome is an important pathological mechanism behind it. The unimpeded state of the sea of yang meridians directly affects the circulation of Qi and Blood, thereby influencing the functional states of various parts of the body.

I adopted the patting manipulation to promote blood circulation and enhance physical constitution. Meanwhile, in my diet, I focused on pungent and sweet transforming into yang to supplement the body's Yang qi. A friend asked why my tongue is moist; it is actually because I pay attention to regulating the kidney yin deficiency pattern, thereby achieving Yin-Yang balance in the body. Everyone should also be mindful that during seasonal transitions, they need to protect their Qi of meridians to prevent invasion by pathogenic qi from the external environment. In daily life, we can also regulate bodily functions and improve our immunity through reinforcing and reducing by opening and closing. As for a peeled tongue, it needs to be comprehensively diagnosed in conjunction with pulse conditions and other symptoms, so I will not elaborate here.

中医认为人体健康与自然界的平衡息息相关，以“生之本”为理论基础，探讨了多种疾病的发生机制及治疗方法。例如，“消渴类病”和“汗类病”，这两种病症均与体内阴阳失衡有关。对于“汗类病”，可以采用“刮痧疗法”促进气血流通，调节阴阳平衡。而针对“消渴类病”，则需注重调养脾胃，使水谷精微得以正常输布。此外，“解表透疹”是治疗外感发热的重要手段之一。在骨骼系统疾病中，“骨”的病变尤为关键，通过补肾壮骨等方法可以达到治疗效果。“水气凌心证”和“痰闭心窍证”则多见于心血管疾病患者，需采取相应措施调理心肾功能，恢复心脏的正常运作。||TCM believes that human health is closely related to the balance of nature, based on the "Foundation of life" theory, discusses the occurrence mechanism and treatment methods of various diseases. For example, "wasting and thirst disorders" and "sweating disorders," both of these diseases are related to the imbalance of Yin and Yang in the body. For "sweating disorders," Guasha therapy can be used to promote the circulation of Qi and Blood, regulating the balance of Yin and Yang. As for "wasting and thirst disorders," it is necessary to focus on nourishing the spleen and stomach, so that the normal distribution of water and grain essence can be achieved. Additionally, "remove wind and promote skin eruption" is one of the important methods for treating exogenous fever. In bone system diseases, the lesions of "bone" are particularly critical; through methods such as tonifying the kidney and strengthening bones, therapeutic effects can be achieved.
