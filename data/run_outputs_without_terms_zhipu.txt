Methods HPLC was used to establish the fingerprint spectra of the traditional decoction and formula granules of Sangju Yin. The chemical composition differences between the traditional decoction and formula granules were analyzed from four aspects: types of chemical components, similarity of fingerprint spectra, chemical pattern recognition analysis, and contents of representative index components. Results The similarity of the fingerprint spectra of 10 batches of traditional decoction was all >0.988, with 35 characteristic peaks identified, including 12 common peaks (No. 7 peak as neochlorogenic acid, No. 10 peak as chlorogenic acid, No. 11 peak as cryptochlorogenic acid, No. 13 peak as 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, No. 17 peak as rutin, No. 19 peak as forsythoside A, No. 20 peak as luteoloside, No. 24 peak as isochlorogenic acid B, No. 25 peak as 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, No. 31 peak as phillyrin, No. 32 peak as linarin, No. 35 peak as ammonium glycyrrhizinate); the similarity of the fingerprint spectra of formula granules was all >0.983, with 29 characteristic peaks identified. Compared with the traditional decoction, some batches of formula granules lacked peaks No. 14, 26, 27, 30, 32, and 34. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis could all distinguish between the two. The contents of the index components neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythoside A, luteoloside, isochlorogenic acid B, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, phillyrin, and linarin in the traditional decoction were higher than those in the formula granules, while the contents of rutin and ammonium glycyrrhizinate in the formula granules were higher than those in the traditional decoction. Conclusion There are differences in the types and contents of components between the formula granules and the traditional decoction of Sangju Yin. The combination of fingerprint spectra and chemical pattern recognition can effectively evaluate the differences between the traditional decoction and formula granules of Sangju Yin, laying a foundation for the quality control and rational clinical application of Sangju Yin formula granules.>>>///>>>

女性宫颈癌的发生与高危型人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染关系密切，及时有效地阻断高危型 HPV 感染对预防宫颈癌的发生有重要意义。黄元御的“一气周流”理论思想崇尚中土，注重整体气机的调畅，可阐释女性的生理病理。而高危型 HPV 感染的发生与中焦脾土失运，气机周流不畅，机体抗邪能力低下致清浊升降失常有关。基于“一气周流”理论结合“治未病”思想，笔者提出“未病先防，调畅中土存正气”“既病防变，升降相因祛毒邪”“瘥后防复，阴阳平衡和气血”的高危型 HPV 感染的防治原则，以期为临床治疗提供参考。||The occurrence of cervical cancer in women is closely related to the infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), and timely and effective blocking of high-risk HPV infection is of great significance for the prevention of cervical cancer. Huang Yuanyu's theory of "One Qi Circulation" advocates the centrality of the earth element and emphasizes the smooth regulation of the overall Qi mechanism, which can explain the physiological and pathological aspects of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is related to the dysfunction of the spleen earth in the middle Jiao, the obstruction of Qi circulation, and the low resistance of the body leading to abnormal ascending and descending of clear and turbid substances. Based on the theory of "One Qi Circulation" combined with the concept of "treating disease before it arises", the author proposes the prevention and treatment principles for high-risk HPV infection: "prevent disease before it occurs, regulate and smooth the middle earth to preserve vital Qi", "prevent progression when disease occurs, balance ascending and descending to eliminate pathogenic factors", and "prevent recurrence after recovery, harmonize Yin and Yang to balance Qi and blood", in order to provide a reference for clinical treatment.

The pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) is the deficiency of heart qi and yang, and the prolonged dysfunction of the triple energizer's qi transformation, progressing from deficiency to excess in the later stages, manifesting as a mixture of deficiency and excess. The Poria, Cinnamon Twig, Atractylodes, and Licorice Decoction (abbreviated as "Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang") functions through the "Four-in-One" approach: its nature is acrid, sweet, and warm, with a mild sweetness and bitterness, where acrid and sweet warmness transforms qi and promotes diuresis, supports yang, and eliminates fluid retention, while the mild bitterness permeates water and dries dampness, unblocking water pathways; its position targets the heart, spleen, and triple energizer, invigorating heart yang, strengthening the spleen to eliminate fluid retention, and regulating the water pathways of the triple energizer; its potential acts simultaneously upward and downward, internally and externally, unblocking above and benefiting below, disseminating externally and replenishing internally, thereby facilitating the triple energizer's water pathways; its syndrome addresses the deficiency of heart yang and the overflow of water and fluid retention, being more applicable in treating heart diseases with upward rushing water qi. The dysfunction of the triple energizer and the recurrent episodes of CHF are mutually causative; Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang can warm the fire of the triple energizer's qi transformation and unblock its pathways, effectively addressing the systemic fluid retention in CHF. Its pharmacological effects include anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of myocardial cell membrane ion channels, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, and regulation of vascular constriction and dilation. Deconstructing Ling Gui Zhu Gan Tang from the "Four-in-One" perspective and exploring its mechanism in treating CHF in conjunction with the theory of "triple energizer qi transformation" holds significant importance for revitalizing the vitality of classical formulas and their precise and effective application.

尿毒症瘙痒（UP）是终末期肾脏病患者常见并发症，严重降低患者生活质量。中医外治法治疗 UP 相较于中药内治法操作简便、起效迅速，且能避免口服药物所致首关效应及可能带来肝肾损伤，治疗手段主要包括中药外洗、药浴、熏洗、湿敷、灌肠、刮痧、针刺、耳穴贴压、穴位敷贴、穴位离子导入、自体血穴位注射等。目前，多数研究在西医常规治疗基础上加用中医外治法，可提高疗效，在改善瘙痒症状、炎症指标、睡眠质量及焦虑抑郁状态等方面具有一定优势；一些研究选取甲状旁腺激素、血磷、CRP、IL-6、组胺、SCr、BUN、β2-微球蛋白等指标评价疗效，结果提示中医外治法可改善患者微炎症状态，保护肾功能，但其作用机制有待进一步研究。现有研究存在以下问题：临床疗效评价量表不统一，难以横向比较和总结；瘙痒症状的缓解依据量表评判，主观性较强；研究疗程较短，无法评判远期疗效和安全性；部分研究未指明患者证型，难以体现中医辨证论治优势等，今后还需完善。||Uremic pruritus (UP) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, significantly reducing their quality of life. Traditional Chinese medicine external therapies for UP are simpler to operate and quicker to take effect compared to internal herbal treatments, and they can avoid the first-pass effect of oral medications and potential liver and kidney damage. The main treatment methods include external washing with herbal decoctions, medicinal baths, fumigation and washing, wet compresses, enemas, scraping, acupuncture, ear point pressing, acupoint plastering, acupoint iontophoresis, and autologous blood acupoint injection. Currently, most studies add external TCM therapies to conventional Western treatments, which can enhance efficacy and have certain advantages in improving pruritus symptoms, inflammatory markers, sleep quality, and anxiety and depression states. Some studies use indicators such as parathyroid hormone, blood phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, and β2-microglobulin to evaluate efficacy, suggesting that external TCM therapies can improve patients' micro-inflammatory state and protect renal function, but their mechanism of action needs further research. Existing studies have the following issues: the clinical efficacy evaluation scales are not unified, making it difficult to compare and summarize horizontally; the relief of pruritus symptoms is based on scale assessments, which are highly subjective; the treatment duration is short, making it impossible to judge long-term efficacy and safety; some studies do not specify the patients' syndrome types, making it difficult to reflect the advantages of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, which needs to be improved in the future.

Methods Retrieve clinical research literature on TCM treatment of SAP from the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI), China Academic Journal Database (Wanfang Data), Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database (Chongqing VIP), and China Biomedical Literature Service System (SinoMed) up to February 28, 2022. Use Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, and SPSS Statistics 22.0 software for frequency statistics, cluster analysis, and association rule analysis of TCM data to summarize core prescriptions. Results Included 289 prescriptions, involving 185 Chinese herbs, and including 38 types of TCM syndromes. Based on the overall study of SAP "disease", it was found that the clinical treatment of SAP mainly involves drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, tonifying deficiency and strengthening the body, and regulating qi and resolving phlegm. Herbs with higher frequency of use include Chuanxiong, Danshen, Gancao, Huangqi, and Danggui; commonly used herb pairs include Chuanxiong-Danggui, Chuanxiong-Honghua, and Chuanxiong-Zhishi. The drug complex network diagram and cluster analysis show that the modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction is the basic prescription for treating SAP; based on the study of SAP "syndrome", it was found that qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, phlegm and blood stasis syndrome, and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome are common TCM syndromes in SAP, and the drugs used in all three are mainly warm and neutral; the flavors are mainly sweet, pungent, and bitter, mostly attributed to the liver, spleen, lung, and heart meridians. Among them, the qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome uses the Buyang Huanwu Decoction composed of high-frequency drugs such as Huangqi, Chuanxiong, and Danshen as the basic prescription; the phlegm and blood stasis syndrome often uses the Gualou Xiebai Banxia Decoction combined with Taohong Siwu Decoction composed of high-frequency drugs such as Zhibanxia, Chuanxiong, and Xiebai as the basic prescription; the qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome uses the Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction composed of high-frequency drugs such as Chuanxiong, Danggui, and Zhike as the basic prescription. Drug cluster analysis shows that qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome can be divided into 3 categories, and phlegm and blood stasis syndrome can be divided into 4 categories. Conclusion Deficiency, blood stasis, phlegm, and stagnation are important pathological factors of SAP, among which qi deficiency is the basis of the disease, and blood stasis runs through the entire course of the disease, sometimes accompanied by phlegm turbidity and qi stagnation syndromes. Focusing on the pathogenesis of deficiency in the root and excess in the branch, clinical treatment often involves tonifying deficiency drugs and promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis drugs, with syndrome differentiation and selection of prescriptions.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory posits that stroke is primarily caused by "deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, blood stasis, and qi" factors; when pathogenic qi accumulates and obstructs the meridians, it leads to stagnation of qi and blood, damage to the tendons, and muscle atrophy, resulting in stroke-induced flaccid paralysis. Therefore, the main treatment approach is to unblock the meridians and soften the tendons. Fire needle therapy for stroke flaccid paralysis acts to unblock meridians, warm yang, soften tendons, and alleviate pain. It can warm yang to dispel cold, nourish meridian qi, release tendon nodules, promote the flow of qi and blood, and nourish the limbs and bones. Fire needle therapy can facilitate the recovery of neural pathways, enhance local metabolism, improve local muscle tone, thereby restoring limb function. High-quality clinical research on fire needle treatment for post-stroke flaccid paralysis, selection of acupuncture points, and standardized operational techniques await further exploration.

五善七恶是一种判断中医外科疾病预后的理论，被诸多中医古籍提及，为历代外科医家重视，但现代文献对其论述较少。五善七恶首见于《太平圣惠方》，其理论源自《灵枢·玉版》中的“逆顺”。五善七恶经过历代医家的发挥，衍生出诸多变体。通过梳理历代医籍对五善七恶的记载，发现主要版本有两大类：一是《太平圣惠方》版及其衍生版（痘疹五善七恶、五善七恶救援法等）；二是《外科正宗》版及其衍生版。||The theory of "Five Goods and Seven Evils" is a method for judging the prognosis of surgical diseases in traditional Chinese medicine, mentioned in many ancient TCM texts and valued by generations of surgical practitioners, but less discussed in modern literature. The concept first appeared in "Taiping Shenghui Fang" and its theory originates from the "Reverse and Direct" in "Lingshu·Yuban". Through the elaboration of medical practitioners over the ages, various variants of the "Five Goods and Seven Evils" have emerged. By reviewing the records of the "Five Goods and Seven Evils" in medical texts from different dynasties, it is found that there are mainly two major versions: one is the "Taiping Shenghui Fang" version and its derivatives (such as the "Five Goods and Seven Evils of Smallpox", "Rescue Methods of Five Goods and Seven Evils", etc.); the other is the "Waike Zhengzong" version and its derivatives.

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。||A systematic review of the Longdan Xiegan Decoction in various generations of medical books reveals that the original version recorded in "Lan Shi Mi Cang" primarily targeted male diseases characterized by smelly genitalia. Through Xue Ji's modifications, the indications gradually expanded, leading to confusion in the formula's name, composition, and origin. This issue is particularly evident in "Jing Yue Quan Shu" and "Yi Fang Ji Jie". Previous physicians mostly interpreted this formula from the perspective of internal organs. Switching to a meridian-based perspective for re-interpretation might better elucidate the governing principles of Longdan Xiegan Decoction. Classifying genital diseases under the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian and ailments like hypochondriac pain and deafness under the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, and adjusting the medication based on the condition, not only facilitates a comprehensive and profound understanding of the formula for precise clinical syndrome differentiation and medication but also encourages modern researchers to re-examine the crucial role of meridian theory in the formation and development of the entire Traditional Chinese Medicine theoretical system.

《本草纲目》作为明代代表性本草著作，书中所附植物图像以另一种形式保留了李时珍对药材基原植物的考证结果，真实反映了明代对药物与植物的认识与利用情况。以书中木部香木类植物图像为例，通过考证图像所绘植物基原，以揭示明代对植物知识与药物性质的认识水平。木部香木类所载的 25 幅图像中，20 幅图像准确描述了植物的叶花及果实等，杉图对植物三尖杉形态细节的表述等均证明了明代对植物形态与药物性质认识处于较高水平。但乌药、阿魏等共 5 图的错误也说明明代对植物形态的认识仍有局限之处。通过图像考证结果与文字所载药性对比可知，明代对药性的了解程度已然鞭辟着里，对部分植物的药性认识甚至高于对其形态的了解。||"The Compendium of Materia Medica," as a representative herbal work of the Ming Dynasty, preserves Li Shizhen's research results on the original plants of medicinal materials in another form through the attached plant images, truly reflecting the understanding and utilization of drugs and plants during the Ming Dynasty. Taking the images of aromatic wood plants in the wood section of the book as an example, by researching the original plants depicted in the images, it reveals the level of understanding of plant knowledge and drug properties in the Ming Dynasty. Among the 25 images recorded in the wood section of aromatic wood plants, 20 images accurately describe the leaves, flowers, and fruits of the plants, and the detailed depiction of the morphology of Cephalotaxus fortunei in the cedar image, etc., all prove that the understanding of plant morphology and drug properties in the Ming Dynasty was at a relatively high level. However, the errors in the 5 images of radix linderae, asafoetida, etc., also indicate that there were still limitations in the understanding of plant morphology during the Ming Dynasty. By comparing the research results of the images with the recorded drug properties in the text, it can be seen that the understanding of drug properties in the Ming Dynasty had already been profound, and the understanding of the medicinal properties of some plants was even higher than that of their morphology.

通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。||By analyzing relevant unearthed documents and transmitted texts, this paper elucidates the treatment details of "Stone Carbuncle. The highest is the Stone Spirit, which must already be cured; the next is Stone Blood, which can be separated; the lowest is Stone Pus, of which eleven survive" in the "Reversal and Sequence of the Five Colors of Pulse and Visceral Manifestation of Spirit" from the Tianhui Medical Bamboo Slips, and expounds its connection with the theories of transmitted medical classics. Compared with the stone needle therapy in the "Pulse Method" of the Mawangdui and the "Pulse Book" of Zhangjiashan, the "Stone Spirit" method for treating carbuncles in the Tianhui Medical Bamboo Slips is used before the accumulation of blood and the formation of pus in carbuncles, which can prevent the progression of the disease and achieve a "must already be cured" effect. Additionally, the diagnostic and treatment methods related to stone carbuncle may have inspired the later "Regulating Spirit" thought and the theory of preventive treatment to a certain extent.

《伤寒类证便览》是明新安医家陆彦功编集整理的一部伤寒类医籍，计 12 卷，初刊于明弘治十二年（1499）。国内外现存有 3 种版本：一种为藏于日本内阁文库全本和辽宁中医药大学图书馆藏的残本，两地藏本均为婺源汪范依据陆氏保和堂于明弘治十二年刊本进行缮写翻刻的刻本，刊刻时间不详，原保和堂弘治十二年刊本未见；一种为藏于四川省图书馆的所谓“明弘治刻本”；一种为藏于上海中医药大学图书馆的清代精抄本。其文献来源主要有《伤寒类证》《注解伤寒论》《伤寒明理论》《活人书》《太平惠民和剂局方》《此事难知》《伤寒图歌活人指掌》《胎产药方》《小儿伤寒药方》。该书使已经亡佚的《伤寒类证》得以较完整地流传下来。||"Shang Han Lei Zheng Bian Lan" is a collection of Shang Han (febrile disease) medical texts compiled and organized by Lu Yankong, a physician from Xin'an during the Ming Dynasty, consisting of 12 volumes, first published in the 12th year of Hongzhi (1499). There are currently three extant versions both domestically and internationally: one is a complete copy stored in the Japanese Cabinet Library and a fragmentary copy in the Library of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, both of which are block-printed copies transcribed and re-carved by Wang Fan from Wuyuan based on the original edition published by Lu's Baohe Tang in the 12th year of Hongzhi, with the carving date unknown, and the original Baohe Tang edition from the 12th year of Hongzhi has not been seen; another is the so-called "Ming Hongzhi block-printed edition" stored in the Sichuan Provincial Library; and another is a refined Qing Dynasty manuscript stored in the Library of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The main sources of its literature include "Shang Han Lei Zheng", "Zhu Jie Shang Han Lun", "Shang Han Ming Li Lun", "Huo Ren Shu", "Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang", "Ci Shi Nan Zhi", "Shang Han Tu Ge Huo Ren Zhi Zhang", "Tai Chan Yao Fang", and "Xiao Er Shang Han Yao Fang". This book has allowed the already lost "Shang Han Lei Zheng" to be passed down more completely.
