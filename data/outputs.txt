Methods HPLC method was used to establish fingerprint maps of traditional decoction and medicinal granules of Sangju drink. The chemical composition differences between traditional decoction and medicinal granules were analyzed from four aspects: types of chemical components, similarity of fingerprint maps, chemical pattern recognition analysis, and content of representative indicator components. Results The similarity of fingerprint maps of 10 batches of traditional decoctions was all >0.988, identifying 35 characteristic peaks, with 12 shared peaks (peak 7 as neochlorogenic acid, peak 10 as chlorogenic acid, peak 11 as cryptochlorogenic acid, peak 13 as 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, peak 17 as rutin, peak 19 as forsythoside A, peak 20 as luteolin glycoside, peak 24 as isochlorogenic acid B, peak 25 as 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, peak 31 as forsythiaside, peak 32 as linarin, peak 35 as ammonium glycyrrhizinate); the similarity of fingerprint maps of medicinal granules was all >0.983, identifying 29 characteristic peaks. Compared with traditional decoctions, some batches of medicinal granules lacked peak 14, 26, 27, 30, 32, and 34. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis could distinguish the two. The contents of indicator components such as neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythoside A, glycoside, isochlorogenic acid B, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythiaside, and linarin in traditional decoctions were higher than those in medicinal granules; the contents of rutin and ammonium glycyrrhizinate in medicinal granules were higher than those in traditional decoctions. Conclusion There are differences in component types and contents between medicinal granules and traditional decoction pieces of Sangju drink. The combination of fingerprint map and chemical pattern recognition can effectively evaluate the differences between traditional decoction and medicinal granules of Sangju drink, laying the foundation for the quality control and clinical rational application of Sangju drink medicinal granules.

女性宫颈癌的发生与高危型人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染关系密切，及时有效地阻断高危型 HPV 感染对预防宫颈癌的发生有重要意义。黄元御的“一气周流”理论思想崇尚中土，注重整体气机的调畅，可阐释女性的生理病理。而高危型 HPV 感染的发生与中焦脾土失运，气机周流不畅，机体抗邪能力低下致清浊升降失常有关。基于“一气周流”理论结合“治未病”思想，笔者提出“未病先防，调畅中土存正气”“既病防变，升降相因祛毒邪”“瘥后防复，阴阳平衡和气血”的高危型 HPV 感染的防治原则，以期为临床治疗提供参考。||The occurrence of female cervical cancer is closely related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Effectively blocking high-risk HPV infection in time is of great significance for the prevention of cervical cancer. Huang Yuanju's theory of "Qi circulation" venerates the central earth, emphasizing the smooth flow of overall Qi, which can explain the physiology and pathology of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is associated with the dysfunction of spleen-earth transportation in the middle-jiao, the unsmooth flow of Qi circulation, and the decline in the body's ability to resist evil influences, leading to the disorder of clear and turbid ascending and descending movements. Based on the theory of "Qi circulation" combined with the idea of "preventing a disease before it arises", the author proposes the principles of "preventing a disease before it arises and maintaining the smooth flow of Qi in the central earth to preserve righteous Qi", "preventing transmission of a disease after its onset and using ascending and descending movements to remove toxic influences", and "after recovery, preventing recurrence by balancing yin and yang and harmonizing Qi and blood" for the prevention and treatment of high-risk HPV infection, aiming to provide reference for clinical treatment.

“四位一体”是基于“性、位、势、证”四维角度的研究思路，有助于多维度、立体化地辨识分析经方。慢性心力衰竭（CHF）病机为心气心阳亏虚、三焦气化失司日久，后期由虚向实进展可见虚实夹杂。茯苓桂枝白术甘草汤（简称“苓桂术甘汤”）通过“性、位、势、证”四位发挥作用：方性为辛甘而温，淡甘兼苦，辛甘温以化气利水、扶阳涤饮，淡苦以渗水燥湿、通利水道；方位为心、脾、三焦，可鼓舞心阳、健脾蠲饮、通调三焦水道；方势为上下并行、内外兼修、通上利下、宣外补内，则三焦水道借势通达；方证为心阳亏虚、水饮泛滥痰饮证，治疗水气上冲性心脏病应用为多。三焦失司与 CHF 反复发作互为因果，苓桂术甘汤可暖三焦气化之火、通三焦气化之道，针对 CHF 的全身性水液潴留发挥作用；其药理作用有抗炎、抗血小板聚集、调节心肌细胞膜离子通道、抗缺血再灌注损伤、调控血管舒缩等。从“四位一体”的角度解构苓桂术甘汤，并结合“三焦气化”理论探讨苓桂术甘汤治疗 CHF 机制，对重新焕发经方生命力及精准有效应用经方具有重要意义。||The concept of "Four-in-One" is based on the research perspective of "nature, position, trend, and syndrome," which helps to identify and analyze classic formulas from multiple dimensions and perspectives. For chronic heart failure (CHF), the pathogenesis involves deficiency of heart qi and heart yang, and long-term dysfunction of qi transformation in the triple energizer (sanjiao), eventually progressing to a mixed condition of deficiency and excess. The formula Fuling Guizhi Baishu Gancao Decoction (referred to as Linggui Shutigan Decoction) exerts its effects through "nature, position, trend, and syndrome": its nature is pungent-sweet and warm, with a bland-sweet and slightly bitter taste. It uses pungent-sweet warmth to promote qi transformation and diuresis, and to support yang and eliminate fluid retention; it uses blandness and bitterness to penetrate and dry dampness and regulate water passages. Its position involves the heart, spleen, and triple energizer, invigorating heart yang, strengthening the spleen to eliminate fluid retention, and regulating the water passages of the triple energizer; its trend is simultaneous action above and below, internal and external regulation, promoting urination below while clearing exterior symptoms, thus facilitating the water passages of the triple energizer. Its syndrome is characterized by deficiency of heart yang and flooding of water and phlegm-dampness, commonly used for treating heart diseases caused by upward rushing of water qi. Dysfunction of the triple energizer and recurrent episodes of CHF are interrelated causes and effects. Linggui Shutigan Decoction can warm the fire of qi transformation in the triple energizer and facilitate the channels of qi transformation in the triple energizer, playing a role in addressing systemic fluid retention in CHF. Its pharmacological actions include anti-inflammatory effects, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of myocardial cell membrane ion channels, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, and regulation of vascular tone. By deconstructing Linggui Shutigan Decoction from the perspective of "Four-in-One" and combining it with the theory of qi transformation in the triple energizer, we can explore the mechanism of its treatment for CHF, which is of significant importance for rejuvenating the vitality of classic formulas and their precise and effective application.

尿毒症瘙痒（UP）是终末期肾脏病患者常见并发症，严重降低患者生活质量。中医外治法治疗 UP 相较于中药内治法操作简便、起效迅速，且能避免口服药物所致首关效应及可能带来肝肾损伤，治疗手段主要包括中药外洗、药浴、熏洗、湿敷、灌肠、刮痧、针刺、耳穴贴压、穴位敷贴、穴位离子导入、自体血穴位注射等。目前，多数研究在西医常规治疗基础上加用中医外治法，可提高疗效，在改善瘙痒症状、炎症指标、睡眠质量及焦虑抑郁状态等方面具有一定优势；一些研究选取甲状旁腺激素、血磷、CRP、IL-6、组胺、SCr、BUN、β2-微球蛋白等指标评价疗效，结果提示中医外治法可改善患者微炎症状态，保护肾功能，但其作用机制有待进一步研究。现有研究存在以下问题：临床疗效评价量表不统一，难以横向比较和总结；瘙痒症状的缓解依据量表评判，主观性较强；研究疗程较短，无法评判远期疗效和安全性；部分研究未指明患者证型，难以体现中医辨证论治优势等，今后还需完善。||Uremia pruritus (UP) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, significantly reducing the quality of life. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) external treatment methods for UP are operationally simple, take effect rapidly, and can avoid the first-pass effect of oral medication as well as potential liver and kidney damage. The main treatment methods include external washing with herbal decoctions, medicated baths, fumigation and washing, wet compresses, enemas, Gua Sha, acupuncture, ear acupressure, acupoint application, iontophoresis, and autologous blood injection at acupoints. Currently, most studies add TCM external treatment methods to conventional Western medicine treatments, which can improve efficacy, and have certain advantages in improving symptoms of itching, inflammatory indicators, sleep quality, and anxiety-depression status; some studies use indicators such as parathyroid hormone, serum phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, β2-microglobulin to evaluate efficacy, suggesting that TCM external treatment methods can improve the micro-inflammatory state of patients and protect renal function, but their mechanisms of action require further study. Existing research has the following issues: inconsistent clinical efficacy evaluation scales make it difficult to compare and summarize results horizontally; relief of itching symptoms relies heavily on subjective evaluation by scales; short treatment courses prevent assessment of long-term efficacy and safety; some studies do not specify patient syndrome types, making it difficult to demonstrate the advantages of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, among others. Further improvements are still needed.

糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）为糖尿病常见慢性并发症，可导致足部溃疡、坏疽，严重者可导致截肢，影响患者生活质量。DPN属中医“痹病”“痿病”等范畴，主要病机为气血阴阳亏虚，痰浊瘀血痹阻脉络，临床以气虚血瘀证多见。本文基于《黄帝内经》“气脉常通”理论，提出DPN气虚血瘀证患者的治疗应以“益气活血、化瘀通痹”为原则，使患者气脉通达，延缓疾病进展，为DPN的中医治疗提供参考。||Diabetes peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a common chronic complication of diabetes, can lead to foot ulcers, gangrene, and in severe cases, amputation, thereby affecting the patient's quality of life. DPN falls within the scope of traditional Chinese medicine as "arthritis" and "flaccidity syndrome," primarily involving deficiencies in qi, blood, yin, and yang, with phlegm-dampness and blood stasis obstructing the meridians. Clinically, qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern is commonly observed. Based on the theory of "qi and blood always flowing smoothly" from the Huangdi Neijing, this article proposes that for patients with qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern in DPN, treatment should follow the principle of "tonifying qi and activating blood, resolving stasis and unblocking the meridians," aiming to facilitate the smooth flow of qi and blood in patients, thus delaying disease progression, and providing reference for the TCM treatment of DPN.

The core pathogenesis is the disorder of qi and blood, damage to the heart spirit, dysfunction of ascending and descending movements, and failure of the pivot to function. Treatment should focus on regulating both ascending and descending movements of qi and blood. The treatment principle is to tonify qi and activate blood circulation, and adjust the ascending and descending movements. Tonifying qi and activating blood circulation should prioritize tonifying qi first, and appropriately select blood-activating herbs based on the degree of blood stasis, so that the blood vessels become unblocked and the spirit has a place to rely on; adjusting the ascending and descending movements should focus on regulating the liver's ascent and lung's descent as well as the spleen and stomach, paying attention to the ascending, descending, floating, and sinking properties of the herbs, in accordance with the physiological functions of the zang-fu organs, to restore the ascending and descending movements of qi in the zang-fu organs.

Currently, there is no clear solution for the reproductive damage caused by Tripterygium wilfordii. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii should be attributed to its pungent, bitter, cold, and cool nature; long-term use can deplete liver blood, injure liver yang, consume kidney essence, and damage kidney yang, disrupting the balance of qi, blood, yin, and yang in the zang-fu organs, leading to infertility. This paper proposes understanding the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii from the perspective of "Yi (liver) and Gui (kidney) share the same source" based on the relationship between the liver and kidney and human reproductive function, and explores methods to reduce reproductive toxicity according to the idea of "treating the liver and kidney together," aiming to expand theoretical thinking in TCM for safe clinical application.

Methods Clinical research articles on TCM treatment of SAP from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, and SinoMed system up to February 28, 2022, were retrieved. The software tools Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, and SPSS Statistics 22.0 were used for frequency statistics, cluster analysis, and association rule analysis of TCM drug data to summarize core prescriptions. Results A total of 289 prescriptions involving 185 types of herbs and 38 syndromes were included. Based on the overall study of SAP "disease," it was found that the main treatments for clinical SAP are drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, tonifying deficiencies and reinforcing healthy qi, and regulating qi and transforming phlegm. Frequently used herbs include Ligusticum chuanxiong, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Astragalus membranaceus, and Angelica sinensis; commonly used herb pairs include Ligusticum chuanxiong-Angelica sinensis, Ligusticum chuanxiong-Carthamus tinctorius, and Ligusticum chuanxiong- Citrus aurantium. Drug complex network diagrams and cluster analysis show that modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction is the basic prescription for treating SAP. Based on the study of SAP "syndrome," Qi deficiency-induced blood stasis pattern, intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern, and qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern are relatively common TCM syndromes in SAP, with warm and neutral properties predominating in medication for all three patterns; flavors are mainly sweet, pungent, and bitter, often entering the liver, spleen, lung, and heart meridians. Among them, Qi deficiency-induced blood stasis pattern uses modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction composed of frequently used drugs such as Astragalus membranaceus, Ligusticum chuanxiong, and Salvia miltiorrhiza as the basic prescription; intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern commonly uses modified Gualou Xiebai Banxia Decoction combined with Tao Hong Siwu Decoction composed of frequently used drugs such as Pinellia prepared, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Allium macrostemon, etc., as the basic prescription; qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern uses modified Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction composed of frequently used drugs such as Ligusticum chuanxiong, Angelica sinensis, and Citrus aurantium as the basic prescription. Cluster analysis shows that Qi deficiency-induced blood stasis pattern and qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern can be divided into 3 categories, while intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern can be divided into 4 categories. Conclusion Deficiency, blood stasis, phlegm, and stagnation are important pathogenic factors in SAP, among which qi deficiency is the basis of disease onset, blood stasis runs through the entire course of the disease, or may be accompanied by phlegm turbidity and qi stagnation. In line with the pathogenesis of fundamental deficiency and superficial excess, clinical treatment mostly involves tonic medicines and drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, with syndrome differentiation in selecting prescriptions.

中风软瘫以中风后患者身体运动功能异常，肌肉张力下降为主要表现，是中风后较为常见的病理状态，软瘫时间越长预后越差。中医理论认为，中风主因“虚、风、火、痰、瘀、气”而发病，当邪气搏结、阻于经络则使气血凝滞、经筋损伤、肌肉痿废，导致中风软瘫，因此需立以通经柔筋为其主要治法。火针治疗中风软瘫具有通经温阳、柔筋止痛的作用，可温阳散寒、充养经脉经气、松解筋脉结节、推动气血运行、濡养四肢百骸。火针疗法可促进神经通路的恢复，加强局部新陈代谢，改善局部肌张力，从而恢复肢体功能。火针治疗中风后软瘫的高质量临床研究、选穴规律、规范化操作手法等有待进一步深化。||Stroke with flaccid paralysis is mainly characterized by abnormal motor function and decreased muscle tone in patients after stroke, which is a relatively common pathological state post-stroke. The longer the flaccid paralysis persists, the worse the prognosis. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, stroke primarily occurs due to "deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, blood stasis, and qi stagnation." When pathogenic factors gather and obstruct the meridians, it leads to stagnation of qi and blood, damage to sinews and muscles, resulting in flaccid paralysis post-stroke. Therefore, the main treatment method should focus on unblocking the meridians and softening the sinews. Fire needle therapy for flaccid paralysis after stroke has the effect of unblocking the meridians, warming yang, and softening the sinews to relieve pain, capable of warming yang and dispersing cold, nourishing the meridians and qi, releasing the knots in the sinews, promoting the circulation of qi and blood, and moistening the limbs and all body parts. Fire needle therapy can promote the recovery of neural pathways, enhance local metabolism, improve local muscle tone, thereby restoring limb function. High-quality clinical studies, acupoint selection rules, and standardized operational techniques for fire needle therapy in treating flaccid paralysis after stroke require further development.

防风通圣散具有外散风热、内泻热结功效。回归刘完素学术思想本源，可知防风通圣散应以治风为标，治热为本，标本同治，表里双解，当为火热偏盛、内外俱实的病证而设。近年来，国内对本方的基础与临床研究方向主要有皮肤病、内分泌代谢疾病、消化系统疾病、呼吸系统疾病等，而国外相关研究则集中于肥胖相关的代谢疾病。研究发现，防风通圣散具有抗过敏、调节免疫、改善代谢紊乱等作用。目前，国内防风通圣散基础研究相对不足，对本方的机制探讨还需更加深入，且需开展更多大样本、高质量RCT。||Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder has the effects of dispelling wind-heat externally and purging internal heat accumulation. Tracing back to Liu Wansu's academic ideas, it can be known that Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder should treat wind as the manifestation and heat as the root, practicing both treating the manifestation and root simultaneously, resolving exterior and interior syndromes together, designed for conditions with excessive fire and solidness inside and outside. In recent years, domestic research directions on this formula mainly include skin diseases, endocrine and metabolic disorders, digestive system diseases, respiratory system diseases, etc., while foreign related studies focus on metabolic diseases associated with obesity. Research findings show that Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder has effects such as anti-allergy, immune regulation, and improvement of metabolic disorders. Currently, basic research on Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder in China is relatively insufficient, further in-depth exploration of its mechanisms is needed, and more large-sample, high-quality RCTs should be conducted.

临床可从中医“血脉之心”与“神明之心”认识双心疾病，把握“气血失和、清浊不分”的核心病机，传承并创新蒲辅周先生“畅气血、重升降”学术思想，以及国医大师薛伯寿“和合思想”，从双心失调本质出发，以“气血同调、升清降浊”为核心治法。其中，气血同调应虚实异治，若以虚为主，需体用联合以调补气血，常用双和散；以实为主，需动静结合以通顺血脉，常用黄芪赤风汤、越鞠丸。升清降浊应斡旋气机、补泻合宜，常用升降散调气开郁，补中益气汤益气升清，枳术汤、枳术丸泄浊逐秽。||Clinical management of dual heart diseases can be understood from the TCM perspectives of "the blood and qi heart" and "the spirit heart," grasping the core pathogenesis of "disharmony of qi and blood, unclear distinction between clear and turbid." Inheriting and innovating Mr. Pu Fuzhou's academic thought of "smooth flow of qi and blood, emphasis on ascending and descending functions," as well as Master Xue Boshou's concept of "harmonization and integration," treatment should start from the essence of dual heart disharmony, focusing on "regulating qi and blood in unison, promoting ascending clarity and descending turbidity." In regulating qi and blood in unison, it should adopt different treatments for deficiency and excess conditions; if deficiency is predominant, use a combination of constitutional and functional regulation to replenish qi and blood, commonly using Shuanghe Powder; if excess is predominant, combine dynamic and static methods to unblock and smooth the flow of blood, commonly using Huangqi Chifeng Decoction and Yueju Pills. For promoting ascending clarity and descending turbidity, qi mechanism should be regulated appropriately with supplementation and drainage, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate qi and resolve depression, Tonify the Spleen and Stomach Decoction to invigorate qi and promote ascending clarity, and Zhizhu Decoction or Zhizhu Pills to eliminate turbid and remove filth.

大肠息肉的临床表现与湿邪黏滞、重着等特性相符，其好发人群的中医体质多与湿相关。易引发大肠息肉的肠道菌群失调、肠道微炎症状态、神经-内分泌-免疫网络和水通道蛋白异常等病理变化与湿邪现代机制研究结果相符。认为饮食不节、情志不畅等因素导致脾虚湿蕴，各种病邪交织形成有形异物是湿邪引发大肠息肉的中医病机。根据湿邪的致病特征，结合大肠息肉的发病因素，探讨湿邪在大肠息肉发病中的影响，以期为临床中大肠息肉的中西医结合诊疗提供有效的中医理论依据。||The clinical manifestations of colorectal polyps are consistent with the characteristics of dampness such as stickiness and heaviness, and the physical constitution of susceptible individuals in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is often related to dampness. The pathological changes such as dysbiosis of intestinal flora, low-grade intestinal inflammation, abnormalities in the neuro-endocrine-immune network, and aquaporin abnormalities that easily lead to colorectal polyps are consistent with the modern mechanisms of dampness. It is considered that factors like dietary irregularities and emotional stagnation lead to spleen deficiency and dampness accumulation, and various pathogenic factors intertwine to form tangible foreign bodies, which is the TCM pathogenesis of dampness causing colorectal polyps. According to the disease-causing characteristics of dampness and combined with the causative factors of colorectal polyps, the influence of dampness in the onset of colorectal polyps is discussed, aiming to provide effective TCM theoretical basis for the integrated diagnosis and treatment of colorectal polyps in clinical practice.

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。||A systematic review of the Longdan Xiegan Decoction in ancient medical texts revealed that the original formula recorded in "Lanshi Micang" primarily targeted diseases of male external genitalia odor. After modifications by Xue Ji, the scope of its application gradually expanded, leading to confusion in the names, compositions, and origins of the formulas, with "Jingyue Quanshu" and "Yifang Jijie" highlighting this issue more prominently. Previous medical practitioners often interpreted this formula from the perspective of zang-fu organs, but shifting the viewpoint to meridians may better elucidate the therapeutic rules of Longdan Xiegan Decoction. The conditions of the external genitalia should be attributed to the liver meridian of foot-jueyin, while lateral chest pain, tinnitus, and other symptoms should be attributed to the gallbladder meridian of foot-shaoyang, and medication should be adjusted according to the condition, which is conducive to a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the formula for accurate clinical diagnosis and medication, and can also prompt modern researchers to reconsider the significant role of meridian theory in the formation and development of the entire TCM theoretical system.

通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。||By comparing and analyzing the relevant texts from excavated documents and transmitted documents, the detailed treatment methods of "Shiju. The Supreme is Stone Spirit, if the Stone Spirit has already occurred; the next is Stone Blood, Stone Blood can be divided; the lowest is Stone Abscess, Stone Abscess has eleven chances of survival" in the "Reversal and Order of Five Colors Pulse Zang Inspection of Spirit and Vitality" chapter of the "Medical Texts from Tianhui" are elucidated to reveal their connection with the theories of existing medical classics. Compared to the stone puncture methods in the Ma Wang Dui's "Pulse Methods" and the Zhang Jia Shan's "Pulse Texts", the "Stone Spirit" method for treating carbuncles and boils in the "Medical Texts from Tianhui" can be applied before the blood accumulates and abscesses form in carbuncles and boils, preventing the progression of the condition and achieving the effect of "certain cure". Additionally, the diagnostic and therapeutic methods related to stone carbuncle may have inspired the subsequent "adjustment of spirit" thought and the theory of preventing diseases before they arise.
