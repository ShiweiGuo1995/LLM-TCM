最近天气转凉，不少朋友反映早上起床时总是感觉口干舌燥，甚至出现口齿病类的症状，比如牙龈肿痛、口腔溃疡等。中医认为，这可能是体内“阳”气不足，导致“悬饮”内停，影响了津液的正常分布。特别是那些经常熬夜的朋友，更容易出现“五更泄泻”的情况，早上天还没亮就急着跑厕所。对于小朋友来说，秋冬季节还要警惕“小儿天花”这类传染病的侵袭，家长们要注意给孩子保暖，避免受凉。如果孩子鼻塞严重，可以试试“通鼻”的小妙招，比如用温热的毛巾敷鼻子，或者按摩迎香穴。此外，饮食上也要注意调理，避免过食寒凉，尤其是“下消”体质的朋友，更要少吃生冷食物，以免加重“筋疝”等问题。总之，秋冬养生要顺应自然规律，内外兼修，才能健康过冬！||Recently, the weather has turned cooler, and many friends have reported feeling dry mouth and throat upon waking up in the morning, even experiencing symptoms related to tooth and mouth diseases, such as swollen gums and oral ulcers. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that this may be due to insufficient Yang Qi in the body, leading to the retention of pleural fluid retention disorder, which affects the normal distribution of body fluids. Especially for those who frequently stay up late, they are more prone to early morning diarrhea, rushing to the bathroom before dawn. For children, parents should be vigilant against infectious diseases like paediatric smallpox during the autumn and winter seasons, and pay attention to keeping their children warm to avoid catching cold. If a child has severe nasal congestion, they can try small tricks to unblock the nose, such as applying a warm towel to the nose or massaging the Yingxiang acupoint. Additionally, dietary adjustments should be made, avoiding excessive consumption of cold and raw foods, especially for those with a constitution prone to wasting of the lower jiao, to prevent aggravating issues like varicocele. In summary, health preservation in autumn and winter should follow natural laws, with both internal and external cultivation, to ensure a healthy winter!

在中医理论中，"脉从四时"强调了人体脉象随季节变化而调整的重要性，体现了天人相应的整体观念。对于"火形人"而言，由于其体质偏热，易出现"齿漏"、"胆瘅"等症状，因此在治疗上常采用"发散风寒药"以调和内外。同时，"沉肩坠肘"不仅是太极拳中的基本要领，也是中医养生中调节气血流通的重要方法。此外，"补益精髓"对于维护"肾阴"的平衡至关重要，肾阴充足则能有效预防多种疾病，促进健康长寿。这些中医术语和实践方法共同构成了中医养生和治疗的重要组成部分。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the concept of "Correspondence between the pulse and the four seasons" emphasizes the importance of adjusting the pulse conditions in accordance with seasonal changes, reflecting the holistic concept of man–nature correspondence. For individuals with a "Fire personality," due to their constitution being prone to heat, symptoms such as "Dental fistula" and "Cholecystitis" are likely to occur. Therefore, in treatment, "Pungent warm exterior-releasing medicines" or "Wind-cold dissipating medicines" are often used to harmonize the internal and external. Meanwhile, "Relax the shoulders, sink the elbows" is not only a fundamental principle in Taijiquan but also an important method in TCM health preservation for regulating the flow of Qi and Blood. Additionally, "Tonify essence and marrow" is crucial for maintaining the balance of "Kidney yin," as sufficient Kidney yin can effectively prevent various diseases and promote health and longevity. These TCM terms and practical methods together constitute an essential part of TCM health preservation and treatment.

在中医理论中，难产常与血寒证及血虚风燥证相关联，这些证候可能导致孕妇气血运行不畅，进而影响分娩过程。手少阳三焦经证则涉及体内水液代谢的调节，其失调可能加剧身肢放长的症状，影响孕妇的体态和分娩能力。中土常守的概念强调了脾胃功能的重要性，脾胃虚弱可能使孕妇更易受到中毒及意外伤害类的影响。两感则是指内外邪气同时侵袭，这在孕妇中可能导致复杂的病理变化，增加难产的风险。因此，中医在治疗难产时，常综合考虑这些证候，通过调理气血、强化脾胃功能及调节三焦经来达到治疗目的。||In TCM theory, difficult delivery is often associated with the blood cold pattern and blood deficiency-induced wind dryness pattern. These patterns may lead to poor circulation of qi and blood in pregnant women, thereby affecting the delivery process. The Sanjiao meridian pattern involves the regulation of water metabolism within the body, and its dysfunction may exacerbate the symptom of lengthening the torso and limbs, affecting the pregnant woman's posture and delivery capability. The concept of keeping the central equilibrium emphasizes the importance of spleen and stomach functions. Spleen and stomach deficiency may make pregnant women more susceptible to poisoning and accidents/unintentional injuries. Damage to paired meridians refers to the simultaneous invasion of internal and external pathogenic qi, which may lead to complex pathological changes in pregnant women, increasing the risk of difficult delivery. Therefore, in treating difficult delivery, TCM often comprehensively considers these patterns, aiming to achieve therapeutic goals by regulating and harmonizing qi and blood, strengthening spleen and stomach functions, and regulating the Sanjiao meridian.

最近有朋友问我，面色苍白、食欲不振怎么办？这让我想到了中医里的“补脾健胃”理念。脾虚胃弱，确实容易导致面色苍白、消化不良。中医讲究“酸甘化阴”，像山楂、乌梅这些酸味食物，搭配甘味的红枣、蜂蜜，既能开胃又能滋阴。如果体内湿气重，还可以考虑用“逐水剂”来调理。不过，如果出现“肉瘿”这类问题，还是要及时就医。另外，情绪对身体的影响也不容忽视，“情志相胜法”告诉我们，保持心情舒畅对健康至关重要。像“风毒炽盛证”这种急性病症，更要及时处理，避免病情加重。总之，养生要从日常饮食、情绪调节入手，才能让“水轮”运转顺畅，身体自然健康！||Recently, a friend asked me what to do about a pale facial complexion and poor appetite. This reminded me of the concept of "tonifying qi of the spleen and stomach" in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Spleen deficiency and stomach weakness can indeed lead to a pale facial complexion and indigestion. TCM emphasizes the principle of "sour and sweet transform into yin." Sour-flavored foods like hawthorn and dark plum, when paired with sweet-flavored ingredients such as red dates and honey, can both stimulate the appetite and nourish yin. If there is excessive dampness in the body, one might consider using "formulas that expel water" for regulation. However, if issues like "fleshy goiter" arise, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly. Additionally, the impact of emotions on the body should not be overlooked. The "restraining emotions method" teaches us that maintaining a cheerful mood is crucial for health. Acute conditions like the "exuberance of wind toxin pattern" require timely treatment to prevent worsening. In summary, health preservation should start with daily diet and emotional regulation to ensure the smooth functioning of the "water wheel," leading to natural health and well-being.

For example, for "Twitching of the eyes" caused by spleen and stomach deficiency, symptoms can be alleviated by tonifying the spleen and stomach. Additionally, "Draining purgative medicines" play a significant role in treating excess pattern constipation, while "Eliminate stasis and regenerate blood" is commonly used to address skin issues such as "Headless boils" caused by blood stasis. In acupuncture treatment, "Xi-cleft points" as specific points are often used for the relief of acute pain. It is noteworthy that certain special conditions such as "Tinea pedis" (a type of skin infection) and "Excessive thinking pattern" (a condition caused by excessive thinking) also require special attention in clinical practice. These TCM theories and practical methods reflect the holistic concept and the characteristics of treatment based on pattern identification and differentiation.

When treating wind dizziness, TCM often uses wind-dispelling and dampness-overcoming formulas to harmonize pathogenic wind within the body and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, the principle of the four mistakes is extremely important during the treatment process, which includes avoiding raw and cold foods, emotional fluctuations, overexertion, and exposure to wind and cold. For the excessive fear pattern, TCM believes it is related to disharmony between the heart and the kidney, and treatment requires the use of formulas that calm the mind to soothe the spirit. The spleen and kidney yang deficiency pattern is characterized by cold limbs and soreness and weakness in the lower back and knees, and treatment requires warming and tonifying the spleen and kidney. In the treatment of haemorrhoids, subcutaneous needle insertion is an effective external treatment method, which promotes local blood circulation by stimulating specific points. In summary, TCM emphasizes comprehensive regulation in treating these conditions to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and the root.

在中医理论中，"下法"是一种重要的治疗方法，主要用于通过促进排泄来清除体内的病邪。例如，对于"足阳明胃经"相关的疾病，如"火淫证"，下法可以有效缓解症状。此外，"肝肾阴虚证"和"痰气郁结证"也是常见的病理状态，前者表现为阴虚火旺，后者则与气机郁滞有关。在治疗这些证型时，中医强调调和阴阳，疏通气机。对于孕妇，"止血安胎"是治疗中的重要原则，旨在保护胎儿和母体健康。在诊断过程中，观察舌象如"滑苔"可以提供重要的病理信息。中医认为，人体各器官如"相傅之官"般协同工作，维持生命活动的平衡。通过综合运用这些理论和方法，中医能够有效地治疗和预防多种疾病。||In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, the "Draining downward method" is an important therapeutic approach primarily used to eliminate pathogenic factors from the body by promoting excretion. For instance, in diseases related to the "Stomach meridian of foot-Yangming," such as the "Pathogenic fire pattern," the Draining downward method can effectively alleviate symptoms. Additionally, the "Yin deficiency of the liver and kidney pattern" and the "Phlegm qi stagnation pattern" are common pathological states; the former manifests as "Yin deficiency leading to fire hyperactivity," while the latter is associated with "Qi stagnation." In treating these patterns, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes harmonizing Yin and Yang and regulating Qi movement. For pregnant women, "Stop bleeding and secure the fetus" is a crucial principle in treatment, aimed at protecting the health of both the fetus and the mother. During the diagnostic process, observing tongue manifestations such as "Slippery coating" can provide significant pathological information. Traditional Chinese medicine holds that the organs of the human body work in concert like "The prime minister organ" to maintain the balance of life activities. By comprehensively applying these theories and methods, traditional Chinese medicine can effectively treat and prevent various diseases.

The Phlegm-fire harassing the heart system pattern is primarily characterized by excessive heart fire and internal disturbance of phlegm heat, leading to restlessness of the spirit. Treatment should focus on clearing heat and transforming phlegm, as well as calming the heart and stabilizing the spirit. Red thread-like boil is often caused by dysfunction of the liver's governing of ascending and dispersing, leading to qi impediment and blood stasis. Treatment requires soothing the liver and regulating qi, as well as circulating blood and transforming stasis. Additionally, the Deficiency cold in the small intestine pattern is commonly seen in clinical practice, manifesting as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Treatment should aim to warm the middle and disperse cold, as well as strengthen the spleen and harmonize the stomach. The theory of Reverse restraining among the five elements indicates that dysfunction of the Zang-fu organs can mutually influence each other, such as the liver wood overacting on the spleen earth, leading to dysfunction of the granary organ and disruption of qi's control over body fluids, thereby affecting water metabolism. In summary, treatment with Classical formulas should comprehensively consider the functions of the Zang-fu organs and the relationships of mutual generation and restraint among the five elements to achieve the goal of holistic regulation.

In fact, this is closely related to "The liver opens into the eyes" and "The liver stores the Ethereal Soul (Hun)." When Liver qi is not smooth, the eyes are prone to problems, and dysfunction in the liver's role of storing the Ethereal Soul (Hun) can also affect sleep quality. Additionally, some people may develop "Fusiform fingers," which could be a manifestation of "Fasciolopsiasis" and requires timely regulation. Another friend mentioned having a yellow "Tongue coating," which might indicate "Rooted coating," suggesting the presence of damp-heat in the body. If someone exhibits the "Taiyang blood retention pattern," they might experience symptoms such as frequent urination and painful urination, in which case it is necessary to "Clear and reduce deficiency heat" for regulation. In summary, every small signal from the body could be a hint of some disease, and it is crucial to take these signs seriously!

One can try the Warming method, such as using Suspended moxibustion to warm and tonify the spleen and stomach, thereby enhancing Yang qi. At the same time, the Exuberant heat damaging fluids pattern is also prone to appear in autumn and winter, manifesting as dry mouth and dry skin. At this time, it is appropriate to take some Tranquillizing medicines to help regulate the body's condition. Additionally, since the kidney governs reproduction, sufficient Kidney qi is crucial for overall health, especially for female friends who should pay more attention to tonifying the kidney and nourishing Essence. I hope everyone can maintain physical and mental balance and stay healthy through the winter by following Traditional Chinese Medicine practices this season!

最近天气转凉，不少朋友反映手脚冰凉，尤其是足跟痹痛难忍。这让我想起中医里说的“肝其华在爪”，肝气不足时，指甲容易发白、易断。如果你还伴有气虚血凝证的症状，比如面色苍白、容易疲劳，那就要注意调理了。风寒🗎痹也是秋冬常见的毛病，尤其是老年人容易中招。平时可以多吃些温补的食物，比如红枣、桂圆，帮助益气通便。如果出现风火热毒证的症状，比如口干舌燥、便秘，可以试试清泄里热的食疗方，比如绿豆汤。太阳蓄血证的朋友则要注意保暖，避免受寒。总之，秋冬养生要因人而异，对症调理才能事半功倍！||Recently, the weather has turned cooler, and many friends have reported cold hands and feet, especially with unbearable heel pain. This reminds me of the TCM saying "The lustre of the liver shows in the nails." When liver qi is deficient, nails tend to turn pale and become brittle. If you also experience symptoms of qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern, such as pale facial complexion and easy fatigue, it is important to focus on regulation. Wind-cold-dampness impediment is also a common issue in autumn and winter, particularly among the elderly. It is advisable to consume more warming and nourishing foods, such as red dates and longan, to benefit qi and promote bowel movements. If symptoms of wind fire/heat toxin pattern appear, such as dry mouth and constipation, you can try food therapy to clear and reduce interior heat, such as mung bean soup. Those with Taiyang blood retention pattern should pay attention to keeping warm and avoid cold exposure. In summary, health preservation in autumn and winter should be tailored to individual needs, and targeted regulation will yield twice the result with half the effort!

最近天气炎热，很多人出现了“暑伤津气证”，表现为口干舌燥、乏力无神。这时候，滋阴补血就显得尤为重要了。有些人可能还会出现“天行赤眼”，眼睛红肿疼痛，这时候可以用锋针轻轻刺破耳尖放血，效果不错。另外，精血亏虚证的朋友们也要注意了，尤其是那些长期熬夜、工作压力大的朋友，很容易出现“🗎痹”症状，手脚麻木、关节疼痛。还有“搅肠痧”，肚子疼得像刀绞一样，这时候可以试试艾灸或者按摩足三里。总之，夏天养生要特别注意，别让这些小毛病影响了生活。||Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, and many people have developed the "Summer heat consuming qi and yin pattern," characterized by dry mouth, lassitude, and absence of spirit. At this time, nourishing yin and tonifying blood becomes particularly important. Some individuals may also experience "epidemic conjunctivitis," with red, swollen, and painful eyes. In such cases, using a sharp-edged needle to gently puncture the ear tip for bloodletting can be quite effective. Additionally, those with the "Essence and blood deficiency pattern" should be cautious, especially those who stay up late frequently or are under significant work pressure, as they are prone to symptoms of "fixed impediment," such as numbness in the limbs and joint pain. There is also "dry cholera," where the abdominal pain feels like being twisted by a knife. In such situations, trying moxibustion or massaging the Zusanli (ST36) acupoint can be beneficial. In summary, health preservation during summer requires special attention to prevent these minor ailments from affecting daily life.

最近在门诊遇到不少家长反映孩子出现小儿厌食的情况，这让我想起了中医里常说的胃气亏虚证。其实，孩子的脾胃功能尚未发育完全，很容易受到外界影响。如果再加上饮食不规律，就容易导致胃气亏虚，进而引发厌食。中医讲究行气降逆，通过调理气机来改善症状。此外，有些女性朋友可能会遇到倒经的问题，这其实与阳盛阴衰有关，体内的阴阳失衡会导致月经不调。还有肾风，虽然听起来陌生，但它与肾虚密切相关，尤其是现代人熬夜、压力大，容易伤肾。总之，无论是小儿厌食还是倒经、肾风，中医都有其独特的调理方法，关键是要找到病因，对症下药。||Recently, many parents have reported cases of pediatric poor appetite in the clinic, which reminds me of the Stomach qi deficiency pattern often mentioned in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). In fact, the spleen and stomach functions of children are not fully developed and are easily affected by external factors. If coupled with irregular eating habits, it can easily lead to Stomach qi deficiency, thereby causing aversion to food. TCM emphasizes the importance of circulating and down-regulating qi to improve symptoms by regulating qi movement. Additionally, some female friends may encounter issues such as reversed menstruation, which is actually related to Yang waxing with Yin waning. An imbalance of Yin and Yang in the body can lead to menstrual disorders. There is also Kidney wind, which, although it may sound unfamiliar, is closely related to Kidney deficiency, especially in modern people who stay up late and are under great stress, which can easily harm the Kidneys. In summary, whether it is pediatric poor appetite, reversed menstruation, or Kidney wind, TCM has its unique methods of regulation. The key is to identify the causative factors and treat accordingly.

In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, schistosomiasis is often associated with the pattern of cold dampness obstructing the meridians, where pathogenic cold invades the meridians and collaterals, leading to the obstruction of Qi and Blood circulation. In treatment, clearing heat in the heart and lung is a commonly used method to alleviate symptoms by removing heart fire and purging lung heat. The Shaoyang pattern and the pattern of heat disturbing the heart spirit may also accompany schistosomiasis, manifesting as symptoms such as heart vexation and insomnia.

I recall a patient who came for a consultation last week, complaining of a corn on his foot that caused pain while walking. I advised him to first apply a medicated plaster externally while also regulating his Liver qi. In fact, many minor ailments follow the principle of treating the exterior before the interior. For example, common symptoms of gastric upset are often related to the Qi deficiency of the heart and spleen pattern. For daily regulation, it is appropriate to use some blood-cooling haemostatic medicines, but specific medication should be determined based on individual constitution. Everyone should pay more attention to keeping warm, exercising appropriately, and maintaining a relaxed mood to keep the body in optimal condition!

If improperly treated, it may lead to the transformation of a heat pattern into cold, complicating the condition. Patients with spleen yang deficiency pattern often experience symptoms like indigestion and cold limbs, requiring warming and tonifying spleen yang to restore its function. Profuse nasal discharge and thunder head wind are mostly caused by external wind-heat or internal heat disturbing upwards, necessitating treatments that clear heat, dry dampness, and detoxify to alleviate symptoms. Red butterfly-like sore, a skin disease, is often related to blood heat stasis, and the method of transforming stasis and inducing labor is also applied in such diseases to promote blood circulation and improve skin condition. In summary, TCM treatment requires flexible application of methods such as clearing heat, transforming stasis, and warming and tonifying according to specific patterns to achieve optimal therapeutic effects.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了“瘴毒病”的症状，如头晕、乏力等。中医讲究“开呼合吸”，通过调整呼吸来调和宗气，增强体质。对于女性朋友，如果感觉下腹不适，可能是“胞宫积热证”，建议及时调理，滋阴润燥。此外，户外活动时要注意“松毛虫伤”，一旦被叮咬，可用刚柔相济的方法处理，既要有力度又要温和。如果出现“膀胱蓄血证”，如尿频、尿急，应及时就医。希望大家在日常生活中多关注身体变化，及时调理，保持健康。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many people have shown symptoms of "Miasmatic disorder," such as dizziness and lassitude. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "Opening with breathing out and closing with breathing in," adjusting breathing to harmonize Zong-pectoral qi and enhance physical constitution. For female friends, if there is discomfort in the lower abdomen, it might be a "Blood heat in the uterus pattern," and it is advisable to regulate in time to nourish yin and moisten dryness. Additionally, when engaging in outdoor activities, be cautious of "Pine caterpillar injuries." If bitten, handle with methods that combine hard and soft, being both forceful and gentle. If symptoms of "Blood accumulation in the bladder pattern" appear, such as frequent and urgent urination, seek medical attention promptly. It is hoped that everyone pays more attention to bodily changes in daily life, regulates in time, and maintains health.

在中医理论中，"客邪"是指外来的致病因素，如风寒湿邪等，常导致多种疾病。例如，"口糜"和"喉癣"便是由客邪侵袭口腔和咽喉部位引起的常见病症，表现为口腔黏膜的炎症和咽喉部的癣状病变。此外，"顽癣"和"臀红"也是由客邪引起的皮肤病，前者指顽固性的皮肤癣症，后者则是臀部皮肤的红肿现象。在治疗这些疾病时，中医常采用"闪罐法"，通过快速拔罐来驱散体内的邪气。同时，中医还强调"五轮"理论，即五脏与五官的对应关系，认为肾主水，与"肾风"相关，肾风可导致耳鸣、头晕等症状。因此，治疗时需综合考虑内外因素，以达到最佳疗效。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, "exogenous pathogenic factors" refer to external causative factors such as wind, cold, and dampness, which often lead to various diseases. For example, "oral erosion" and "tuberculosis of the throat" are common conditions caused by the invasion of exogenous pathogenic factors in the oral cavity and throat, manifesting as inflammation of the oral mucosa and tinea-like lesions in the throat. Additionally, "collar sore" and "nappy/diaper rash" are skin diseases caused by exogenous pathogenic factors, with the former referring to stubborn tinea of the skin and the latter being redness and swelling of the skin around the nappy/diaper. In treating these diseases, Traditional Chinese Medicine often employs "flash cupping," which involves rapid cupping to disperse pathogenic qi from the body. At the same time, Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes the "five wheels" theory, which is the correspondence between the five zang organs and the five sense organs, believing that the kidney governs water and is related to "kidney wind," which can cause symptoms such as tinnitus and dizziness. Therefore, treatment requires a comprehensive consideration of internal and external factors to achieve the best therapeutic effect.

最近有朋友问我，总是感觉身体疲惫，精神不集中，甚至有时候会“失神”，这到底是怎么回事呢？其实，这可能是身体的气机不畅，导致“行气降逆”功能失调。中医讲究“开吸合呼”，通过调整呼吸来调节气机，帮助身体恢复平衡。如果你还伴有“经行口糜”或者“小肠泌别清浊”功能不佳，可以试试一些“祛🗎化痰”的食疗方，比如梨汤或者百合粥。此外，如果出汗过多，可以考虑使用“固表止汗剂”来帮助收敛汗液，保护“腠理”。希望这些小建议能帮到你，记得保持良好的生活习惯哦！||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel physically exhausted, mentally unfocused, and sometimes even experience a "loss of spirit." In fact, this may be due to the stagnation of Qi movement in the body, leading to dysfunction in "circulating and down-regulating Qi." Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "opening with breathing in and closing with breathing out," which involves adjusting breathing to regulate Qi movement and help restore the body's balance. If you also suffer from "oral ulceration during menstruation" or poor function of "the small intestine separating the clear from the turbid," you might try some food therapy recipes that "eliminate dampness and transform phlegm," such as pear soup or lily porridge. Additionally, if you experience excessive sweating, consider using "formulas that secure the exterior and stop sweating" to help astringe sweat and protect the interstices. I hope these small suggestions can help you, and remember to maintain good lifestyle habits!

The lung governs the skin and body hair, and external pathogens can easily invade the body through the skin. If you also experience cough and excessive phlegm, it may be due to carbuncle of the ankle joint. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that disharmony between the spleen and stomach pattern can also lead to these issues, especially in individuals with dietary irregularities and significant emotional fluctuations. For regulation, one can try methods to transform phlegm and dissipate nodules, such as using yin-nourishing ingredients like lily and tremella, combined with herbs that circulate blood and resolve stagnation, such as angelica and ligusticum, to help restore the body's balance. If the condition recurs over a long period, the possibility of Jueyin pattern should be considered, and it is advisable to seek professional TCM diagnosis and treatment for pattern differentiation.

最近有不少朋友问我关于“遗精”的问题，其实这在中医里很常见，尤其是“肝旺脾虚证”的朋友更容易出现这种情况。中医认为，遗精多与肾虚、心火亢盛有关，而“肝旺脾虚证”则会导致体内“津”液失调，进一步加重症状。调理时，除了注意饮食清淡、避免熬夜，还可以试试“毫针刺法”，通过刺激特定穴位来平衡体内的气血运行。另外，像“百合病”这种以阴虚为主的病症，也容易引发遗精，建议多吃些滋阴润燥的食物。如果伴有“青盲”或“血分证”的症状，比如视力模糊、面色苍白等，可能需要结合“利水消肿”的方法来调理，帮助身体排出多余的水湿。总之，遗精并不可怕，关键是对症调理，慢慢恢复身体的平衡。||Recently, many friends have asked me about "nocturnal emissions," which is actually quite common in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), especially among those with the "liver hyperactivity with spleen deficiency pattern." TCM believes that nocturnal emissions are often related to kidney deficiency and excessive heart fire, while the "liver hyperactivity with spleen deficiency pattern" can lead to an imbalance of "thin body fluids" (Jin) in the body, further exacerbating the symptoms. For regulation, in addition to maintaining a light diet and avoiding staying up late, one can also try "filiform needling methods," which stimulate specific points to balance the flow of Qi and Blood in the body. Additionally, conditions like "lily bulb disease," which are primarily characterized by yin deficiency, can also easily trigger nocturnal emissions. It is recommended to consume more foods that "nourish yin and moisten dryness." If accompanied by symptoms of "bluish blindness" or "blood phase pattern," such as blurred vision and pale facial complexion, it may be necessary to combine methods that "induce urination and resolve oedema" to help the body expel excess dampness. In summary, nocturnal emissions are not something to fear; the key is to regulate according to the specific pattern and gradually restore the body's balance.

最近有朋友问我，为什么总是感觉胸闷气短，我建议他去看看中医。中医讲究“舍症从脉”，通过“单按”寸脉，可以初步判断身体状况。如果寸脉浮而有力，可能是“内发丹毒”或“宣肺祛痰”不足所致。中医治疗讲究“理气导滞”，通过调理气机，疏通经络，可以有效缓解症状。当然，中医诊断不仅仅是“临时诊断用症候术语”，还需要结合整体情况，避免“怪脉”干扰。希望大家在日常生活中多关注自己的身体信号，及时调理，保持健康。||Recently, a friend asked me why he always feels chest tightness and shortness of breath. I suggested he consult Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM emphasizes the "Precedence of the pulse over symptoms." By "Pressing with one finger" on the "Cun pulsation," one can preliminarily assess the body's condition. If the Cun pulsation is floating and forceful, it might be due to "Erysipelas on the chest, back/low back and hip" or insufficient "Disperse the lung and transform phlegm." TCM treatment focuses on "Regulate qi and resolve stagnation," by regulating "Qi movement" and unblocking the "Meridians and collaterals," which can effectively alleviate symptoms. Of course, TCM diagnosis is not just about using "Symptoms for provisional diagnosis"; it also requires considering the overall situation to avoid interference from "Strange pulse." I hope everyone pays more attention to their body's signals in daily life, adjusts in time, and maintains health.

本研究探讨了“气为血之帅”在“寒饮伏肺证”中的应用，发现该证型患者常伴有“病脉”表现，如脉象沉细或弦紧。通过“祛瘀下胎”疗法，可有效改善患者症状，尤其是对于“胆石病”患者，疗效显著。此外，研究还发现“封藏之本”在调节“睥虚如球”状态中起到关键作用，而“伪膜”的形成则与病情的进展密切相关。综上所述，本研究为相关疾病的治疗提供了新的理论依据和临床参考。||This study explores the application of "Qi is the commander of the blood" in the "Cold fluids affecting the lung pattern," finding that patients with this syndrome often exhibit "Abnormal pulses," such as deep and thin or wiry and tight pulse conditions. Through the "Transform stasis and induce labour" therapy, patient symptoms can be effectively improved, especially for those with "Cholelithiasis," where the therapeutic effect is significant. Additionally, the study found that "The foundation of sealing and storing" plays a crucial role in regulating the "Non-inflammatory oedema of the eyelid" state, while the formation of "Pseudomembrane" is closely related to the progression of the disease. In summary, this study provides new theoretical foundations and clinical references for the treatment of related diseases.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了臀红、🗎伤脾阳证等症状，这其实与肺合皮毛的理论密切相关。中医讲究急方治急病，对于这些突发的症状，我们可以通过贯顶的方法来缓解。特别是对于失荣、乳疽等较为严重的病症，更需要及时调理。此外，花柳毒淋这类病症虽然不常见，但也需要引起重视。在日常生活中，我们可以通过一些简单的中医方法来预防和缓解这些不适，保持身体的平衡与健康。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many people have developed symptoms such as nappy/diaper rash and dampness affecting spleen yang pattern, which is closely related to the theory that the lung governs the skin and body hair. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes the use of fast-acting formulas for acute diseases. For these sudden symptoms, we can alleviate them through the method of holding the head as if suspended from above. Especially for more severe conditions such as cervical malignancy with cachexia and breast abscess, timely regulation is essential. Additionally, although less common, conditions like gonorrhea also require attention. In daily life, we can prevent and alleviate these discomforts through simple TCM methods, maintaining the body's balance and health.

在中医理论中，脏腑辨证是诊断疾病的重要方法，通过分析脏腑功能失调来指导治疗。例如，肝主谋虑，肝气郁结常导致情绪不稳，进而影响全身健康。黄肿病和烂喉痧是常见的疾病，前者多因湿热内蕴，后者则与风热邪毒有关。治疗上，利水渗剂常用于排除体内湿邪，而浓缩丸则因其高效便捷被广泛应用于多种病症。此外，痹症和齿槽风也是临床上常见的疾病，痹症多因风寒湿邪侵袭，导致关节疼痛，齿槽风则与口腔卫生不良密切相关。通过综合运用这些治疗方法，可以有效缓解症状，恢复健康。||In TCM theory, pattern differentiation of zang–fu organs is an important method for diagnosing diseases, guiding treatment by analyzing the dysfunction of zang–fu organs. For example, the liver governs strategic planning, and liver qi stagnation often leads to emotional instability, thereby affecting overall health. Ancylostomiasis and ulcerated throat with red exanthem are common diseases; the former is mostly caused by internal damp-heat, while the latter is related to pathogenic wind-heat. In treatment, diuretic and damp-draining formulas are often used to expel dampness from the body, and condensed pills are widely used for various conditions due to their high efficiency and convenience. Additionally, bi syndrome and dental abscess are also common clinical diseases; bi syndrome is mostly caused by the invasion of wind-cold-damp pathogens, leading to joint pain, while dental abscess is closely related to poor oral hygiene. By comprehensively applying these treatment methods, symptoms can be effectively alleviated and health restored.

在中医治疗中，"分经论治"是一种重要的诊疗方法，它强调根据经络的分布和功能来辨证施治。例如，在处理"痧胀"这类疾病时，医生可能会采用"齐刺"技术，即在同一穴位上进行多次针刺，以增强治疗效果。此外，中医理论中的"母病及子"原则指出，母脏的疾病可能会影响到子脏，因此在治疗时需考虑"母气"的调理。对于"热痢"等热性疾病，中医常采用"先补后攻"的策略，即先通过补益药物增强患者体质，再进行清热解毒的治疗。同时，药物的"四性"（寒、热、温、凉）也是选择治疗方案时不可忽视的因素，以确保治疗的安全性和有效性。||In traditional Chinese medicine treatment, "Formulas based on meridian differentiation" is an important diagnostic and therapeutic method, emphasizing pattern identification and treatment based on the distribution and function of meridians and collaterals. For example, when dealing with diseases such as "Bumpy sand-like exanthem," doctors may employ the "Triple needling" technique, which involves multiple needling at the same acupoint to enhance therapeutic effects. Additionally, the principle of "Mother passing illness to child" in TCM theory indicates that diseases of the mother organ may affect the child organ, thus the regulation of "Mother qi" must be considered during treatment. For heat-related diseases such as "heat dysentery," TCM often adopts the strategy of "Reinforce healthy qi before removing pathogenic factors," which means first strengthening the patient's constitution with tonifying herbs, followed by treatment to clear heat and remove toxins. Meanwhile, the "Four qi" (cold, hot, warm, cool) of herbs are also crucial factors in selecting treatment plans to ensure safety and efficacy.

Clinical observations reveal that patients with Qi collapse pattern often exhibit the pathological state of "Yin alone cannot be generated," while Heart blood stagnation pattern is frequently caused by "Fluids overflowing into the limbs pattern." The application of the (Kao) shoulder striking method, combined with the principle of "Astringe essence and stop seminal emissions," can effectively improve patient symptoms. Experimental results indicate that the method of "Transform dampness and harmonize the Ying nutrients" significantly enhances the efficacy of "Formulas that resuscitate yang and prevent collapse," particularly excelling in the treatment of Qi collapse pattern. This study provides new therapeutic insights for clinical practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine, holding significant theoretical and practical importance.

在中医理论中，小便不禁常与阴虚火旺相关，表现为肾阴不足导致虚火上炎，进而影响膀胱功能。治疗上，可采用炒制药材如炒黄柏以清热燥湿，或使用薄贴外敷以温肾固涩。对于阳明腑证，其症状多与肠胃湿热有关，需清热利湿。精浊则指精液异常，常与肾虚相关，治疗需补肾固精。骨作为肾之府，其健康与肾气密切相关，太平车等传统疗法可通过按摩骨缝以调和气血，促进肾气恢复。综合运用这些方法，可有效改善相关症状，恢复机体平衡。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, urinary incontinence is often associated with Yin deficiency leading to fire hyperactivity, manifested as Kidney yin deficiency causing flaring of deficient fire, which in turn affects the function of the bladder. In treatment, stir-fried medicinal materials such as stir-fried Cortex Phellodendri can be used to clear heat and dry dampness, or thin plaster can be applied externally to warm the Kidney and consolidate astringency. For the Excess Yangming–fu organ pattern, the symptoms are mostly related to damp-heat in the stomach and intestines, requiring clearing heat and draining dampness. Turbid semen refers to abnormal semen, often related to Kidney deficiency, and treatment requires tonifying the Kidney and consolidating essence. As the residence of the Kidney, the health of the Bone is closely related to Kidney qi. Traditional therapies such as Tai Ping Che can regulate and harmonize qi and blood by massaging the bone sutures to promote the recovery of Kidney qi. Comprehensive application of these methods can effectively improve related symptoms and restore the body's balance.

在中医理论中，痰湿是常见的病理产物，其生成与“生痰之源”密切相关，尤其是肝阳上亢时，易导致痰湿内生。针对痰湿阻滞，中医常用“祛痰化湿开窍”之法，通过药物或手法如“太极推手”来疏通经络，促进气血运行。对于痰湿严重者，可选用“涌吐剂”以迅速排除体内痰浊。在药物剂型上，“蜜丸”因其缓释作用，常用于调和药性，适用于慢性痰湿病症。此外，脉象中的“洪脉”常提示体内有热或痰湿壅盛，需结合“痰阻胞宫证”等具体证候进行辨证施治。||In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, phlegm-dampness is a common pathological product, and its generation is closely related to "the source of phlegm generation," especially when liver yang is hyperactive, which can easily lead to internal phlegm-dampness. For phlegm-dampness obstruction, traditional Chinese medicine commonly uses the method of "resolving phlegm, transforming dampness, and opening the orifices," through medications or techniques such as "Taiji pushing hands" to dredge the meridians and collaterals and promote the circulation of qi and blood. For severe cases of phlegm-dampness, "emetic formulas" can be selected to rapidly expel internal phlegm-turbidity. In terms of dosage forms, "honeyed pills" are often used to coordinate the medicinal properties due to their slow-release effect, making them suitable for chronic phlegm-dampness conditions. Additionally, the "surging pulse" in pulse conditions often indicates internal heat or excessive phlegm-dampness, and it is necessary to combine specific syndromes such as "phlegm retention in the uterus pattern" for pattern identification and treatment.

最近天气变化无常，很多朋友都感觉身体不适，尤其是那些有“气滞水停证”的朋友，常常感到胸闷、腹胀。中医认为，这种情况可以通过“表里分消”的方法来调理，比如使用“实按灸”来疏通经络，缓解症状。此外，夏季容易出现的“暑内蕴证”也需要特别注意，可以通过饮食调理和适当的运动来缓解。对于孕妇来说，“妊娠脉”的调理尤为重要，中医认为“肾开窍于耳”，所以孕期多听一些舒缓的音乐也有助于胎儿的健康。如果出现“内生五邪”的情况，建议及时就医，采用“报刺”等针灸疗法来平衡体内的阴阳。希望大家都能在中医的智慧中找到适合自己的养生之道。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many friends have been feeling unwell, especially those with the "Qi stagnation induced water retention pattern," who often experience chest tightness and abdominal distension. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that this condition can be regulated through the method of "release the exterior and clear interior excess," such as using "mild-warm moxibustion" to unblock the meridians and collaterals, thereby alleviating symptoms. Additionally, special attention should be paid to the "summer heat internal accumulation pattern" that is prone to occur in summer, which can be mitigated through dietary adjustments and appropriate exercise. For pregnant women, the regulation of the "pregnancy pulse" is particularly important. TCM holds that "the kidney opens into the ears," so listening to soothing music during pregnancy also contributes to the health of the fetus. If the "five endogenous pathogenic factors" arise, it is advisable to seek medical attention promptly and adopt acupuncture therapies such as "successive trigger needling" to balance the Yin–yang within the body. It is hoped that everyone can find their own way of health preservation through the wisdom of TCM.

最近有朋友问我，为什么总是感觉身体沉重，容易疲劳，还伴有轻微的水肿类病症状。其实，这可能是“思伤脾”导致的。中医认为，脾为“将军之官”，主运化水湿，思虑过度会损伤脾的功能，导致水湿停滞，进而引发水肿。要改善这种情况，可以通过“补益中气”来增强脾的功能，同时结合“滋阴益气”的方法，调理身体的阴阳平衡。如果症状较重，还可以尝试“间隔灸”或“隔物灸”来温通经络，促进气血运行。总之，辨证施治是关键，避免“阳损及阴”的情况发生，才能从根本上解决问题。||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel physically heavy, easily fatigued, and accompanied by mild symptoms of oedema disorders. In fact, this may be caused by "excessive overthinking damages the spleen". Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the spleen is "the general organ", responsible for the host movement of water and dampness. Excessive overthinking can damage the spleen's function, leading to stagnation of water and dampness, which in turn causes oedema. To improve this condition, one can enhance the spleen's function by "tonifying qi of the spleen and stomach", and at the same time, combine it with methods of "supplement qi and nourish yin" to regulate the body's Yin–yang balance. If the symptoms are severe, one can also try "indirect moxibustion" or "insulated moxibustion" to warm and unblock the meridians and collaterals, promoting the circulation of qi and blood. In summary, pattern identification and treatment are key, and avoiding "deficiency of yang affecting yin" is essential to fundamentally solve the problem.

At this time, it might be helpful to try "Guasha therapy," which can dredge the meridians and collaterals and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, summer is also the season when "Yang oedema" is prevalent, which can easily lead to "stone" problems. It is recommended to drink plenty of water to maintain the body's fluid balance. Moreover, emotional management is crucial to avoid the "excessive anger pattern" from harming the body. If skin issues such as "axillary abscess" or "scrotal eczema" occur, remember to seek medical attention promptly. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "seeking yin from yang." In the hot summer, appropriately supplementing with foods that nourish yin, such as mung bean soup and lily, can help balance the body's yin and yang and maintain health.

在中医理论中，燥🗎和营与寒🗎蕴脾证是两种常见的病理状态，前者多因外感燥邪或内伤津液所致，后者则常因寒邪侵袭脾胃引起。五味调和是中医治疗中的重要原则，通过调节食物的五味属性，可以达到平衡阴阳的目的。暑热内郁证多发生在夏季，表现为高热、口渴等症状，需通过清热解暑的方法进行治疗。偏头痛在中医中常与风毒证相关，风邪侵袭头部经络，导致气血运行不畅。诊断时，中医师常采用三部九候遍诊法，通过全面检查患者的脉象、舌象等，以确定病因和病位。单重治疗法则强调针对单一病因进行治疗，以达到最佳疗效。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the patterns of "Dryness and Harmonizing the Ying Nutrients" and "Cold Dampness Encumbering the Spleen" are two common pathological states. The former is often caused by external pathogenic dryness or internal damage to body fluids, while the latter is usually due to the invasion of pathogenic cold affecting the spleen and stomach. The harmonization of the five flavors is an important principle in TCM treatment, aiming to balance Yin and Yang by adjusting the five flavor properties of food. The "Internal Retention of Summer Heat" pattern frequently occurs in summer, presenting symptoms such as high fever and thirst, and requires treatment methods that clear heat and relieve summer heat. Migraine in TCM is often associated with the "Wind Toxin" pattern, where pathogenic wind invades the meridians and collaterals of the head, leading to the obstruction of Qi and Blood flow. During diagnosis, TCM practitioners commonly use the "Diagnosis Methods Using the Three Positions and Nine Indicators" to comprehensively examine the patient's pulse conditions and tongue manifestations to determine the causative factors and disease location. The "Single Weighted Stance" treatment principle emphasizes targeting a single causative factor to achieve optimal therapeutic effects.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友出现了“血寒证”的症状，手脚冰凉、面色苍白，这时候就需要一些“温里药”来调理了。中医讲究“内所因”，认为这些症状往往与体内的寒邪有关。特别是“中焦如沤”，脾胃功能不佳，更容易导致寒邪入侵。有些人还会出现“捻衣摸床”的现象，晚上睡觉时总是觉得冷，甚至不自觉地去摸被子。如果你发现自己有“少阴热化证”的表现，比如心烦、口干，那可能是寒邪化热了。此外，“皮水”问题也不容忽视，皮肤干燥、瘙痒，可能与体内的寒湿有关。对于“肝痨”患者来说，更要注意保暖，避免寒邪进一步损伤肝脏。总之，秋冬季节，调理好体内的寒湿，才能健康过冬。||Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, many friends have experienced symptoms of "Blood cold pattern," such as cold hands and feet and a pale facial complexion. At this time, some "Interior-warming medicines" are needed for regulation. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "Internal pathogenic factors," believing that these symptoms are often related to the "Pathogenic cold" within the body. Especially since the "Middle jiao resembles foam," poor spleen and stomach function can more easily lead to the invasion of cold. Some people may also exhibit "Carphologia," feeling cold while sleeping at night and unconsciously reaching for the blanket. If you notice signs of "Shaoyin heat transformation pattern," such as vexation and dry mouth, it may indicate that the cold has transformed into heat. Additionally, "Skin oedema" issues should not be overlooked; dry and itchy skin may be related to cold and dampness within the body. For patients with "Liver tuberculosis," it is even more important to keep warm to avoid further damage to the liver from cold. In summary, during the autumn and winter seasons, regulating the cold and dampness within the body is essential for a healthy winter.

Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "reinforce the mother (element) for deficiency pattern," so when there is spleen deficiency, one can enhance physical constitution by regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach. Additionally, furuncles are a common issue during this season, especially for those with damp-heat constitution. Female friends should also pay attention to abnormal white leukorrhea, which often indicates excessive dampness in the body. For those suffering from eye diseases, frequent massage of Yuan-primordial points, such as Hegu point, can help alleviate eye fatigue. During pulse diagnosis, if a hesitant pulse is detected, it suggests poor circulation of Qi and Blood in the body, necessitating timely regulation. Finally, observing the complexion is an important diagnostic method in TCM; a normal complexion should be rosy and lustrous. If the complexion appears yellow or pale, one should be alert to potential health issues.

For example, the concept of "the heart dislikes heat" is something we can also feel in daily life. When experiencing restlessness, the body often feels hot and uncomfortable. Additionally, "heart and gallbladder qi deficiency pattern" is a common constitutional issue, manifesting as being easily startled and having restless sleep. For such problems, traditional Chinese medicine often employs the method of "moisten dryness and promote bowel movements" to regulate the body and help restore balance. There is also "pestilence toxin," which is particularly common during seasonal transitions, presenting as erythema and pruritus on the skin. Finally, mentioning "metal personality," individuals with this constitution typically have fair skin, are prone to sweating, and have a cold constitution. I hope everyone pays more attention to their bodily changes in daily life, adjusts in a timely manner, and maintains health.

在中医理论中，五行学说贯穿于疾病的诊断与治疗之中，如寒厥与积聚的形成，往往与五行失衡密切相关。寒厥多因阳气不足，寒气内侵所致，而积聚则是气血瘀滞，痰湿凝结的结果。在治疗上，中医强调舍脉从症，即根据具体症状而非单纯依赖脉象进行辨证施治。例如，对于痧病，常采用清利头目的方法，以疏散风热，缓解症状。此外，蛇丹作为一种外治法，通过局部刺激达到疏通经络、调和气血的目的。主运理论则指导我们根据季节变化调整治疗方案，以适应自然界的变化规律。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the doctrine of the Five Elements permeates the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. For instance, the formation of Cold Syncope and Abdominal Masses is often closely related to the imbalance of the Five Elements. Cold Syncope is mostly caused by insufficient Yang Qi and the invasion of cold, while Abdominal Masses result from Qi and Blood stasis and the congelation of Phlegm and dampness. In treatment, TCM emphasizes the precedence of symptoms over the pulse, meaning that treatment is based on specific symptoms rather than solely relying on pulse conditions for pattern differentiation. For example, in the case of Bumpy Sand-like Exanthem, methods to clear the head and eyes are often used to release the exterior with pungent-cool and remove wind and clear heat, thereby alleviating symptoms. Additionally, Snake-shaped Sore, as an external treatment method, aims to dredge the Meridians and Collaterals and regulate and harmonize Qi and Blood through local stimulation. The theory of Host Movement guides us to adjust treatment plans according to seasonal changes to adapt to the natural laws of the environment.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this condition is often associated with pleural effusion, as the lung governs the skin and body hair, and insufficient lung qi can lead to malnourished skin. It is recommended to regularly use kneading manipulation to massage the soles of the feet to promote the circulation of qi and blood. Additionally, the liver likes free will and hates to be suppressed, and emotional distress can also affect skin health, so maintaining a cheerful mood is crucial. For those with more severe symptoms, trying some food therapy that supplements qi and nourishes yin, such as white fungus and lotus seed soup, can both moisten the lung and nourish yin. For those with heavy summer dampness, eliminating summer heat and releasing the exterior is also key; drinking some mung bean soup or mint tea can help the body expel dampness. The Yangwei meridian, an important meridian for regulating yang qi, can also be cleared through tapping or massage to enhance physical constitution. In summary, cultivating both internally and externally is essential to stay away from disorders like yin jaundice and maintain a healthy state!

在中医理论中，化痰药常用于治疗因痰湿内阻引起的各种症状，如伤风鼻塞和小儿呕吐。伤风鼻塞多由外感风寒引起，表现为鼻塞流涕，此时使用化痰药可以有效缓解症状。小儿呕吐则可能是由于脾胃虚弱或外邪侵袭所致，化痰药在此类情况下也能发挥重要作用。此外，口酸常与胃热或肝胃不和有关，润燥止咳的药物则适用于因肺燥引起的咳嗽。丹痧是一种急性传染病，表现为高热和皮疹，治疗时需结合清热解毒和化痰的方法。真实假虚和痃癖则是中医诊断中的复杂概念，前者指症状看似严重但实际体质尚可，后者指腹中结块，治疗时需辨证施治。综上所述，中医在治疗这些症状时，强调辨证论治，合理使用化痰药和其他相关药物，以达到最佳疗效。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, phlegm-transforming medicines are commonly used to treat various symptoms caused by internal obstruction of phlegm-dampness, such as acute rhinitis and paediatric vomiting. Acute rhinitis is often caused by external wind-cold invasion, manifesting as nasal congestion and runny nose, and the use of phlegm-transforming medicines can effectively alleviate these symptoms. Paediatric vomiting may be due to spleen-stomach deficiency or external pathogen invasion, and phlegm-transforming medicines can also play an important role in such cases. Additionally, a sour taste is often related to stomach heat or liver-stomach disharmony, and medicines that moisten dryness and stop coughing are suitable for coughs caused by lung dryness. Ulcerated throat with red exanthem is an acute infectious disease characterized by high fever and rash, and treatment requires a combination of clearing heat and removing toxins as well as transforming phlegm. True excess with false deficiency and abdominal masses are complex concepts in TCM diagnosis; the former refers to symptoms that appear severe but the actual constitution is still relatively strong, while the latter refers to masses in the abdomen, and treatment requires pattern differentiation and tailored treatment. In summary, TCM emphasizes treatment based on pattern identification and the rational use of phlegm-transforming medicines and other related medicines to achieve optimal therapeutic effects when treating these symptoms.

These methods can effectively alleviate symptoms. Electroacupuncture, as a therapy that combines modern and traditional approaches, stimulates specific points to circulate and down-regulate qi, thereby regulating and harmonizing qi and blood. Additionally, seven emotions causing internal damage often lead to internal wind syndromes such as pathogenic wind pattern, which requires the use of repelling parasites methods to clear damp-heat pathogens from the body. By comprehensively applying these methods, both internal and external treatments can be achieved, enhancing overall health.

最近有朋友问我，总是感觉胸口闷闷的，时不时会“太息”，也就是长叹一口气，这其实是肝气郁结的表现。中医讲究“调和肝脾剂”，通过调理肝脾，可以缓解这种不适。另外，有些人可能会出现“虚痉”的情况，这往往与“肾藏志”功能失调有关。肾主藏精，精不足则志不坚，容易引发身体的各种不适。还有，如果感觉口干舌燥，可能是“气不化津”，这时候可以适当用一些“补阳药”来调理。最后，提醒大家，如果脸上长了“恋眉疮”，别急着挤，这可能是“经络之气”不畅的表现，调理好内在，皮肤问题自然也会改善。||Recently, a friend asked me, always feeling a stuffy sensation in the chest, occasionally experiencing "sighing," which is a manifestation of liver qi stagnation. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "regulating and harmonizing the liver and spleen," through which such discomfort can be alleviated. Additionally, some people may experience "convulsions due to deficiency," often related to dysfunction of "the kidney stores will." The kidney governs the storage of essence; insufficient essence leads to weak will, easily causing various physical discomforts. Moreover, if one feels a dry mouth, it might be due to "qi failing to transform thin fluids," and at this time, some "yang-tonifying medicines" can be appropriately used for regulation. Lastly, it is reminded that if "eyebrow sores" appear on the face, do not rush to squeeze them, as this might be a sign of "qi of meridians" not flowing smoothly. By regulating the internal body, skin issues will naturally improve.

Speaking of dampness, one cannot overlook chronic spleen wind, a condition that often causes fatigue and weakness. If you frequently experience pruritus, especially at night, it may be a sign of the Jueyin pattern. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is believed that the emotion of the kidney is fear, and individuals with significant emotional fluctuations often have insufficient kidney qi. If a floating pulse is detected during pulse diagnosis, it may indicate an external contraction of wind-cold. For pregnant women, urine retention in pregnancy is a common issue that requires timely regulation.

In treatment, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) commonly employs the method of warming yang and dissipating cold, utilizing the compatibility of formulas of Chinese Medicine, such as the use of ascending and floating medicines, to achieve the effects of clearing heat and removing toxins, and cooling blood to resolve heat rash. For the cool dryness pattern, TCM believes it is often due to qi failing to transform thin fluids, and the treatment focuses on tonifying qi and astringing the breast milk to restore the normal metabolism of body fluids. Additionally, for enterobiasis, a parasitic disease, TCM treatment also emphasizes regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach, enhancing physical constitution to prevent the invasion of pathogenic qi. In summary, TCM in treating these diseases emphasizes overall regulation, through the rational use of formulas, to achieve the goal of treating the root cause of the disease.

最近有朋友问我，为什么总是感觉胸口闷闷的，像是有什么东西堵着，尤其是饭后更明显。这让我想到了中医里的“饮停胸胁证”，其实就是体内湿气太重，水饮停滞在胸胁部位。要解决这个问题，可以从“清热排脓”入手，帮助身体排出多余的湿气和毒素。同时，配合“活血消积”的方法，促进血液循环，消除积滞。中医认为“阴脉之海”是调节全身气血的关键，尤其是女性朋友，更要注意调理。如果平时还伴有小便浑浊、腰膝酸软的情况，可能是“膏淋”的表现，这时候“补脾益肾”就显得尤为重要了。另外，中医常说“血能载气”，气血充足才能让身体更健康。至于“漏疳”，虽然听起来陌生，但它其实和脾胃虚弱有关，调理好了脾胃，这些问题自然迎刃而解。||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel a stuffy sensation in the chest, as if something is blocking it, especially after meals. This reminded me of the "Chest/subcostal fluid retention pattern" in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which essentially means excessive dampness in the body causing fluid retention in the chest and subcostal areas. To address this issue, one can start by "Clearing heat and draining the pus" to help the body expel excess dampness and toxins. At the same time, employing methods to "Circulate blood and resolve masses" can promote blood circulation and eliminate stagnation. TCM believes that "The sea of yin meridians" is key to regulating the body's Qi and Blood, especially for women, who should pay more attention to regulating their health. If accompanied by turbid urine and soreness and weakness in the lower back and knees, it may be a manifestation of "Unctuous strangury" or "Chyluria," making it particularly important to "Tonify the spleen and kidney." Additionally, TCM often says that "Blood carries Qi," and sufficient Qi and Blood are essential for a healthier body. As for "Dental fistula," although it may sound unfamiliar, it is actually related to spleen and stomach deficiency. By regulating the spleen and stomach, these issues can naturally be resolved.

在中医理论中，表里俱寒证是一种常见的病理状态，表现为体内外寒邪侵袭，导致阴阳失调。温疫作为外感病的一种，常伴有发热症状，需通过疏邪透表的方法进行治疗。前后配穴法是针灸治疗中的重要策略，通过特定穴位的配合，调节体内气血，缓解如外痔和鼻衄等症状。这些治疗方法不仅体现了中医的整体观念，也展示了其在处理复杂病症中的独特优势。||In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, the exterior–interior excess cold pattern is a common pathological state, characterized by the invasion of pathogenic cold both internally and externally, leading to disharmony between yin and yang. Epidemic febrile disorders, as a type of externally contracted disease, are often accompanied by fever symptoms and require treatment through methods that remove pathogenic factors and release the exterior. The back and front point combination is an important strategy in acupuncture treatment, which regulates the qi and blood in the body and alleviates symptoms such as external haemorrhoids and nosebleed by combining specific points. These treatment methods not only embody the holistic concept of traditional Chinese medicine but also demonstrate its unique advantages in managing complex diseases.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了虚寒证的症状，尤其是产后恶露不绝的妈妈们更要注意保暖。中医讲究釜底抽薪，从根源上调理身体。比如消谷善饥的朋友，可以试试两仪调理法，通过饮食和作息的双重调节来改善体质。风轮理论告诉我们，身体的气血循环就像风车一样，需要保持顺畅。对于风痧这类皮肤病，中医的拢法可以有效缓解症状。总之，养生要顺应自然规律，内外兼修才能达到最佳效果。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many people have shown symptoms of Deficiency Cold Pattern, especially mothers with Persistent Lochia Discharge who should pay more attention to keeping warm. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes Formulas that Remove Firewood from Under the Cauldron, addressing the root cause to regulate the body. For instance, those experiencing Fast Digestion with Rapid Hunger can try the Two Complementary Forces regulating method, improving their constitution through dual regulation of diet and daily routine. The Wind Wheel theory tells us that the circulation of Qi and Blood in the body is like a windmill, needing to remain smooth. For skin diseases such as Wind Rashes, the Gathering Manipulation in TCM can effectively alleviate symptoms. In summary, Health Preservation should follow the natural laws, and only by cultivating both internally and externally can the best results be achieved.

最近在门诊遇到不少朋友提到晚上“梦交”频繁，白天精神不振，这其实与“心包”功能失调有关。中医认为，心包主神明，若心包受扰，易导致睡眠质量下降，甚至出现梦交。此外，长期久坐或运动不当，容易引发“膝痹”，尤其是“瘀血阻络证”的朋友，膝盖疼痛常伴随“喘证”，这是因为气血运行不畅，经络受阻。建议大家平时多练习一些舒缓的“拳势”，既能“除🗎通络”，又能调理“脾系证类”，帮助身体恢复平衡。养生从细节做起，健康从经络开始！||Recently, many friends in the clinic have mentioned frequent "sexosomnia" at night and feeling lethargic during the day, which is actually related to dysfunction of the Pericardium. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the Pericardium governs the Bright Spirit. If the Pericardium is disturbed, it can easily lead to a decline in sleep quality, and even result in sexosomnia. Additionally, prolonged sitting or improper exercise can easily trigger "Knee Impediment," especially for those with the "Stagnant Blood Obstructing the Meridians Pattern," where knee pain is often accompanied by "Dyspnoea Pattern." This is due to poor circulation of Qi and Blood, leading to blocked meridians. It is recommended to practice some gentle "Taijiquan Structures" regularly, which can both "Remove Dampness and Unblock Collaterals" and regulate "Patterns of the Spleen System," helping the body restore balance. Health preservation starts with the details, and health begins with the meridians!

In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, medicated diet is not only a part of daily diet but also an important means of treating diseases, such as improving symptoms of the wind toxin pattern through yin-nourishing purgation. Additionally, the method of repel filth and transform turbidity is used in traditional Chinese medicine to clear damp-heat and toxins from the body, while purging fire and promoting bowel movements are often used to treat constipation caused by internal heat. These methods collectively reflect the comprehensiveness and individuality of traditional Chinese medicine in treating diseases, aiming to achieve the purpose of treatment and disease prevention by regulating the overall state of the body.

在中医理论中，牙疳常与中焦热证相关联，表现为口腔溃疡和牙龈出血等症状，治疗时需补阳益气以调和体内寒热转化。此外，不育类病在中医中多与肾虚水停证有关，肾虚导致水液代谢失常，进而影响生殖功能。风疹块的出现则多因外感风邪，治疗时需注意脉象变化，如短脉的出现可能提示气血不足。综合运用中医辨证施治，可有效调理上述病症，恢复身体健康。||In TCM theory, ulcerative gingivitis is often associated with the heat pattern of the middle jiao, manifesting symptoms such as oral ulcers and gum bleeding. Treatment requires tonifying yang and supplementing qi to harmonize the cold–heat transformation within the body. Additionally, sterility disorders in TCM are mostly related to the water retention due to kidney deficiency pattern, where kidney deficiency leads to abnormal water metabolism, thereby affecting reproductive function. The appearance of urticaria is often due to pathogenic wind, and attention should be paid to changes in pulse conditions during treatment, such as the appearance of a short pulse, which may indicate qi and blood deficiency. Comprehensive application of TCM pattern identification and treatment can effectively regulate the above-mentioned diseases and restore physical health.

In fact, this is a common minor discomfort during pregnancy. Speaking of this, we have to mention the theory of Front-Mu points in traditional Chinese medicine, as targeting the right points can have particularly good regulatory effects.

In fact, this condition is often related to the "Stomach heat pattern," especially for individuals with a "Wood personality," who are more prone to such issues. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "tonifying qi and facilitating its securing function," and this can be achieved through the use of "slow-acting formulas," such as boiling herbs with "mild fire" to gradually regulate the body. During pulse diagnosis, practitioners carefully perform "finger positioning" to sense changes in "pulse conditions" and assess the disease state.

在中医临床实践中，提法是一种重要的诊断手段，通过观察舌象可以辨识多种病症。例如，枯舌与莲花舌的形态差异常提示不同的病理状态，枯舌多见于阴虚内热，而莲花舌则可能与下焦热证相关。此外，吞酸症状常与胃气上逆有关，需结合表实证的辨证施治。对于白疕等皮肤病症，软坚消癥的治疗原则常被采用，以调和气血、疏通经络。这些术语的综合运用，有助于更精准地把握病情，制定个性化的治疗方案。||In clinical practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine, lifting manipulation is an important diagnostic method, through which various diseases can be identified by observing tongue manifestations. For example, the morphological differences between a withered tongue and a lotus tongue often indicate different pathological states; a withered tongue is commonly seen in Yin deficiency with internal heat, while a lotus tongue may be related to heat pattern in the Lower Jiao. Additionally, symptoms of acid regurgitation are often associated with the upward rebellion of Stomach Qi, requiring treatment based on pattern identification of exterior excess pattern.

Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that this condition is often related to poor circulation of qi and blood in the body, and it is recommended to regulate it through methods that "circulate blood and resolve stagnation." For example, one can appropriately drink some warm tea to alleviate the sensation of "thirst with desire to drink." Additionally, external pathogenic factors such as "purpura" and "wind rashes" can easily take advantage of the deficiency, so everyone should pay attention to keeping warm. If the symptoms are severe, one might try "contralateral needling" therapy, which stimulates specific points to unblock the meridians and collaterals.

It is necessary to combine the pathological changes of hydrocephalus and Qi pass for pattern identification and treatment. Purgative medicines, as an important component of meridian guide medicines, are often used to guide drug-induced dermatitis and promote the expulsion of pathogenic qi. However, if the accumulation of drug-induced dermatitis is not cleared in time, it may lead to a prolonged and unhealed condition. Therefore, the rational use of purgative medicines combined with the guiding effect of meridian guide medicines is a key strategy in treating the pattern of true excess with false deficiency. By harmonizing the Qi pass and dredging hydrocephalus, the symptoms of head wind disorder can be effectively alleviated, while improving the local Qi and Blood circulation in patients with facial palsy, achieving the effect of treating both the tip and root.

In the treatment of Yin abscess, TCM often employs the method of awakening the spleen to regulate spleen and stomach functions, promote the circulation of Qi and Blood, and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, the Qi phase pattern is an important factor to consider in the treatment of Yin abscess. Needling methods can effectively dredge the meridians and collaterals, improving conditions of Blood stasis due to Qi stagnation. During the acupuncture process, the technique of holding the head as if suspended from above is commonly used to precisely stimulate acupoints and enhance therapeutic effects. For patients with constipation, medications that moisten the intestine and clear heat can help eliminate internal heat toxins and promote recovery. In summer, summer heat turbidity easily invades the body, exacerbating Yin abscess, thus preventing heatstroke and cooling down are also crucial measures in the prevention and treatment of Yin abscess.

To treat such symptoms, TCM commonly employs "Methods to harmonize and release", alleviating symptoms by harmonizing the exterior and interior and balancing Yin and Yang. For adults, if "Mouth numbness" occurs, it may be related to the stagnation of Qi and Blood, and at this time, the method of "Transform blood stasis and soothe the heart" can be considered, improving local blood circulation by circulating blood and transforming stasis. Additionally, "Vomiting method" as a traditional TCM therapeutic method is suitable for certain excess patterns, expelling pathogenic factors from the body through induced vomiting. In the treatment of breast diseases such as "Breast abscess", TCM may recommend the use of "Suppository/pessary", a form of medication that facilitates local application, aiding direct action on the lesion and promoting recovery. These methods reflect the diversity and specificity of TCM in treating diseases.

The former is often caused by the invasion of pathogenic summer heat leading to internal wind, while the latter results from insufficient yin fluids causing blood dryness. The Shaoyin pattern, as one of the disorders of the six meridians, often manifests as deficiency-cold symptoms, and the dryness-harmonizing stomach formula is used to regulate stomach dryness and promote digestion. The dredging and draining organ in TCM refers to the bladder, and its dysfunction may lead to the heat accumulation in the skin pattern, presenting symptoms such as skin heat and itching. Additionally, profuse, whitish vaginal discharge, a gynecological disease, is often associated with the yin deficiency-induced blood dryness pattern, requiring treatment that focuses on nourishing yin and stopping bleeding. Other patterns, such as the heat accumulation in the skin pattern, require clearing heat and cooling blood to restore the normal function of the skin.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友出现了“寒厥”的症状，手脚冰凉、面色苍白，这其实是体内阳气不足的表现。中医讲究“补肾益髓”，通过调理肾气来增强体质，尤其是“肝系”功能较弱的朋友更要注意。平时可以多喝些温补的汤水，比如《汤头歌诀》里提到的经典方子，简单易做。如果痰多，记得“贮痰之器”肺脏也需要调理，可以试试“噙化”一些润肺的中药丸，效果不错。另外，按摩“合穴”也能帮助疏通经络，缓解不适。至于“膀胱蓄血证”，虽然听起来吓人，但通过合理的饮食和作息调理，也能慢慢改善。总之，养生要趁早，别等身体出问题了才后悔！||Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, many friends have experienced symptoms of "Cold syncope," such as cold hands and feet and a pale facial complexion, which are actually manifestations of insufficient Yang qi in the body. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "Tonify the kidney and benefit marrow," enhancing physical constitution by regulating Kidney qi, especially for those with a weaker Liver system. It is advisable to consume more warming and nourishing soups, such as the classic formulas mentioned in "Decoction formulas/ mnemonics," which are simple to prepare. If there is excessive Phlegm, remember that the lungs, known as "The receptacle to hold phlegm," also need to be regulated. One might try sublingual/buccal administration of moistening Chinese herbal medicines, which can be quite effective. Additionally, massaging the He-sea points can help to unblock the meridians and collaterals, alleviating discomfort. As for the "Blood accumulation in the bladder pattern," although it sounds alarming, it can gradually improve with proper diet and lifestyle adjustments. In summary, health preservation should start early; do not wait until health issues arise to regret inaction!

最近天气多变，很多人出现了“金破不鸣”的症状，嗓子干哑，说话费力。其实，这可能是“风痰阻络证”或“气滞痰阻证”的表现。中医讲究“食治”，建议多吃一些润肺的食物，比如梨、百合等，同时可以搭配一些“发散风热药”来缓解症状。另外，古代医家提到“五色”对应五脏，饮食中也要注意五色搭配，才能调和气血。最近“疫疠”频发，大家更要注意防护，避免外邪入侵。至于“梅毒致痿”这种病症，虽然现代医学已有明确治疗方法，但中医在调理体质方面也有独特优势。总之，养生要顺应自然，内外兼修，才能远离疾病困扰。||Recently, the weather has been changeable, and many people have experienced symptoms of "broken metal failing to sound," such as dry and hoarse throat and difficulty speaking. In fact, this may be a manifestation of the "wind phlegm obstructing the meridians pattern" or "qi stagnation with phlegm retention pattern." Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "food therapy," recommending the consumption of lung-moistening foods such as pears and lilies, while also incorporating "wind-heat dissipating medicines" to alleviate symptoms. Additionally, ancient physicians mentioned that the "five colours" correspond to the "five zang organs," and it is important to pay attention to the combination of the five colours in the diet to regulate and harmonize qi and blood. Recently, "epidemic pestilence" has been frequent, and everyone should pay more attention to protection to avoid the invasion of external pathogens. As for the condition of "syphilis affecting the spinal cord," although modern medicine has clear treatment methods, Traditional Chinese Medicine also has unique advantages in regulating physical constitution. In summary, health preservation should follow nature, with both internal and external cultivation, to stay away from the troubles of disease.

在中医理论中，小儿天花与腰痛虽属不同病症，但其病理机制常涉及表里传变。脾肾亏虚证是导致腰痛的重要病因之一，尤其在由实转虚的过程中，脾肾功能失调更为显著。治疗上，啄法作为一种传统手法，结合除🗎通络的原则，可有效缓解腰痛症状。此外，头风病虽与腰痛无直接关联，但其治疗亦强调通络止痛，体现了中医整体观念的重要性。通过综合运用这些方法，可显著提升治疗效果。||In TCM theory, although paediatric smallpox and lower back pain are different diseases, their pathological mechanisms often involve paired meridian transmission. Deficiency of the spleen and kidney pattern is one of the important causative factors leading to lower back pain, especially during the process of excess transforming into deficiency, where the dysfunction of the spleen and kidney becomes more pronounced. In treatment, pecking manipulation, as a traditional technique, combined with the principle of removing dampness and unblocking collaterals, can effectively alleviate the symptoms of lower back pain. Additionally, although head wind disorder is not directly related to lower back pain, its treatment also emphasizes harmonizing meridians and relieving pain, reflecting the importance of the holistic concept in TCM. By comprehensively applying these methods, the therapeutic effect can be significantly improved.

痿证类病是中医临床常见的一类疾病，其病因多与肝胃气滞证、气滞血瘀证密切相关。肝胃气滞证患者常表现为脘腹胀满、嗳气频繁，而气滞血瘀证则多见疼痛固定、舌质紫暗等症状。在治疗上，中医强调调和气血，疏通经络，以达到大周天的循环畅通。此外，心肾不交证也是痿证类病的重要病因之一，患者常伴有失眠多梦、腰膝酸软等表现。对于月经先期的女性患者，中医认为多与肝郁气滞、血热妄行有关，治疗上需疏肝解郁、清热凉血。暑证则多见于夏季，患者常表现为发热、口渴、汗多等症状，治疗上以清热解暑为主。语言謇涩多见于中风后遗症，中医认为与痰瘀阻络有关，治疗上需化痰通络、活血化瘀。||Wei-flaccidity disorders are a common category of diseases in clinical Chinese medicine, often closely related to the liver qi affecting the stomach pattern and the qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern. Patients with the liver qi affecting the stomach pattern often manifest with epigastric distension and frequent belching, while the qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern is commonly characterized by fixed pain and a purplish-dark tongue body. In treatment, Chinese medicine emphasizes regulating and harmonizing qi and blood, and harmonizing meridians to achieve the smooth circulation of the large heavenly circle. Additionally, the disharmony between the heart and kidney pattern is also a significant causative factor of Wei-flaccidity disorders, often accompanied by symptoms such as insomnia and dream-disturbed sleep, and soreness and weakness of the lower back and knees. For female patients with an early menstrual period, Chinese medicine often attributes this to liver qi stagnation and reckless flow of blood due to heat, requiring treatment to soothe the liver and regulate qi, and to clear heat and cool blood. Summerheat pattern is more common in summer, with patients often presenting with fever, thirst, and excessive sweating, and treatment primarily focuses on clearing heat and relieving summerheat. Slurred speech is often seen in the sequelae of wind stroke, which Chinese medicine associates with phlegm and blood stasis obstructing the meridians, necessitating treatment to transform phlegm and harmonize meridians, and to circulate blood and transform stasis.

最近天气炎热，很多人出现了阴虚火旺的症状，比如口干舌燥、心烦失眠等。这时候可以试试中医的水丸，它不仅能祛暑利湿，还能帮助调理身体。如果你有血虚证的表现，比如面色苍白、头晕乏力，水丸也能起到一定的辅助作用。另外，风热犯肺证的朋友们也要注意，花剥苔的出现可能提示体内有热毒，及时调理很重要。中医常说“壮火食气”，过度的内热会消耗正气，所以平时要注意饮食清淡，避免辛辣刺激。最后，希望每个人都能像“残灯复明”一样，在炎炎夏日中找到属于自己的清凉与健康。||Recently, the weather has been hot, and many people have shown symptoms of Yin deficiency leading to fire hyperactivity, such as dry mouth, vexation, and insomnia. At this time, you can try the Water pill from Traditional Chinese Medicine, which not only dispels summer heat and promotes diuresis but also helps regulate the body. If you exhibit signs of Blood deficiency pattern, such as pale facial complexion, dizziness, and lassitude, the Water pill can also provide some auxiliary effects. Additionally, friends with Wind heat attacking the lung pattern should be cautious, as the appearance of peeled tongue may indicate the presence of heat toxins in the body, making timely regulation crucial. Traditional Chinese Medicine often says, "Hyperactive fire consumes qi," meaning excessive internal heat can deplete healthy qi, so it's important to maintain a light diet and avoid spicy and stimulating foods. Finally, I hope everyone can find their own coolness and health in the scorching summer, just like "the last radiance of the setting sun."

Diabetes during pregnancy is often caused by yin and blood deficiency, leading to lung yin deficiency, and requires nourishing and supplementing lung yin to regulate and harmonize qi and blood. Pestilence eruptions are usually caused by external pestilence toxin and internal damp-heat, leading to skin heat rash, and require clearing heat and removing toxins in treatment. Additionally, the correlation between cold retention in the liver meridian pattern and scrotal eczema is noteworthy, as cold retention in the liver meridian can lead to scrotal eczema, manifesting as scrotal pruritus and discomfort in relaxation and tension. The clinical manifestations of phlegm misting the heart pattern and tetanus are similar, both presenting with unclear spirit and limb convulsions, and require transforming phlegm and opening the orifices, as well as harmonizing meridians in treatment. In summary, diabetes during pregnancy, pestilence eruptions, cold retention in the liver meridian pattern, scrotal eczema, phlegm misting the heart pattern, and tetanus each have distinct characteristics in causative factors, pathogenesis, and treatment, necessitating pattern identification and differentiation to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.

在中医理论中，手太阴肺经是人体十二经脉之一，主要负责调节呼吸和水分代谢。当肺经失调时，可能出现肺燥津亏证，表现为干咳无痰、口干舌燥等症状。此外，心阳的虚弱也可能导致身体机能下降，特别是在小儿异食症中，心阳不足常表现为食欲异常和消化功能紊乱。针对这些症状，中医常采用温补胃阳的方法，通过调理脾胃来增强体质。同时，展指坐腕是一种常见的中医推拿手法，用于缓解上肢疲劳和促进血液循环。在治疗伏梁积气和骨蒸等慢性疾病时，中医强调综合调理，通过药物和手法相结合，达到平衡阴阳、调和气血的目的。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin is one of the twelve regular meridians in the human body, primarily responsible for regulating respiration and water metabolism. When the lung meridian is imbalanced, it may lead to the Lung Heat and Yin Deficiency Pattern, characterized by symptoms such as dry cough without phlegm, dry mouth, and dry tongue. Additionally, deficiency of Heart Yang may also result in a decline in bodily functions, particularly in pediatric parorexia, where insufficiency of Heart Yang often manifests as abnormal appetite and digestive disorders. To address these symptoms, TCM commonly employs methods to warm and tonify Stomach Yang, enhancing physical constitution by regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach. Meanwhile, the Tuina manipulation technique known as "Sunken Wrist with Finger Extension" is frequently used to alleviate upper limb fatigue and promote blood circulation. In the treatment of chronic diseases such as masses in the upper abdomen and bone-steaming tidal fever, TCM emphasizes comprehensive regulation, combining herbal medicine and manual techniques to achieve the balance of Yin and Yang and the harmonization of Qi and Blood.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友反映出现了耳鸣的症状，这让我想起了中医里常说的“肾气虚证”。肾开窍于耳，肾气不足时，耳朵就容易出问题。如果你也有类似困扰，不妨试试艾条温灸肾俞穴，既能温补肾阳，又能辛温通窍，缓解耳鸣。另外，心主神志，情绪波动也会影响耳鸣，所以保持心情平和很重要。如果伴有痰多的情况，可以尝试化痰除湿的食疗方，比如陈皮煮水，既能清泻肺胃，又能帮助身体排痰。当然，如果症状严重，还是要及时就医，必要时医生可能会建议使用吐法来排除体内痰湿。希望这些小建议能帮到大家！||Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, many friends have reported experiencing tinnitus, which reminds me of the commonly mentioned "Kidney qi deficiency pattern" in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The kidney opens into the ears, and when kidney qi is insufficient, the ears are prone to problems. If you are also troubled by similar issues, you might consider trying moxibustion with a moxa stick on the Shenshu acupoint, which can both warm and tonify kidney yang and open the orifices with pungent warmth to alleviate tinnitus. Additionally, the heart governs mental activities, and emotional fluctuations can also affect tinnitus, so maintaining a calm mood is important. If accompanied by excessive phlegm, you can try food therapy to resolve phlegm and eliminate dampness, such as boiling tangerine peel, which can clear heat in the lung and stomach and help the body expel phlegm. Of course, if symptoms are severe, it is still necessary to seek medical attention promptly, and the doctor may recommend the vomiting method to expel phlegm and dampness from the body when necessary. I hope these small suggestions can help everyone!

在中医理论中，寒入络证是一种常见的病理状态，主要表现为寒邪侵袭经络，导致气血运行不畅。着痹则是由于风寒湿邪侵袭关节，引起关节疼痛和活动受限。针对这些症状，中医常采用补心益肺和益胃生津的治疗方法，以增强机体的正气，促进气血的流通。此外，解表清暑也是夏季常用的治疗手段，用以缓解暑湿引起的不适。对于咳血症状，中医认为多与肺热或肺阴虚有关，需通过调理肺气来止血。客运和脉厥则是中医诊断中的重要概念，客运指的是气血在经络中的运行状态，而脉厥则是指脉搏的异常变化，常用来判断病情的深浅和预后。综合运用这些中医术语和治疗方法，可以有效缓解多种疾病症状，提升患者的生活质量。||In TCM theory, the pattern of cold entering the collaterals is a common pathological state, primarily manifested as the invasion of pathogenic cold into the meridians and collaterals, leading to the obstruction of qi and blood circulation. Fixed impediment is caused by the invasion of wind, cold, and dampness into the joints, resulting in joint pain and limited movement. For these symptoms, TCM often employs methods such as tonifying the heart and lung and nourishing yin and benefiting the stomach to enhance healthy qi and promote the circulation of qi and blood. Additionally, releasing the exterior and clearing summer heat is a commonly used treatment in summer to alleviate discomfort caused by summer dampness. For haemoptysis, TCM believes it is often related to lung heat or lung yin deficiency and requires regulating lung qi to stop bleeding. Guest movement and blood syncope are important concepts in TCM diagnosis; guest movement refers to the state of qi and blood circulation in the meridians and collaterals, while blood syncope refers to abnormal changes in the pulse, often used to determine the severity and prognosis of the disease. By comprehensively applying these TCM terms and treatment methods, it is possible to effectively alleviate various disease symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients.

产后身痛是许多新妈妈常见的症状，通常与气血不足、寒湿侵袭有关。中医认为，产后身痛多因气血运行不畅，导致寒热往来，表现为身体各部位的疼痛。此外，蛀节疔和肉刺也是常见的皮肤问题，多因湿热内蕴或燥邪侵袭所致。热困脾证则表现为脾胃功能失调，常伴有食欲不振、腹胀等症状。外障类病如鼻渊，多因风寒湿邪侵袭鼻窍，导致鼻塞、流涕等症状。中医治疗这些病症时，常采用调理气血、祛风散寒、清热利湿等方法，以恢复身体的平衡状态。||Postpartum body ache is a common symptom among many new mothers, often related to Qi and Blood deficiency and the invasion of cold and dampness. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that postpartum body ache is mostly due to the poor circulation of Qi and Blood, leading to alternating fever and chills, manifested as pain in various parts of the body. Additionally, boils on the knuckle and corns are common skin problems, mostly caused by internal damp-heat or the invasion of pathogenic dryness. The pattern of heat encumbering the spleen is characterized by dysfunction of the spleen and stomach, often accompanied by symptoms such as poor appetite and abdominal distension. Eye disorders involving the eyelid, inner/outer canthus, sclera and iris, such as nasal sinusitis disorder, are mostly caused by the invasion of wind-cold-dampness into the nasal cavity, leading to symptoms such as nasal congestion and runny nose. In TCM treatment of these diseases, methods such as regulating and harmonizing Qi and Blood, dispelling wind and dispersing cold, clearing heat and draining dampness are often used to restore the body's balance.

In fact, there are many methods in Traditional Chinese Medicine to regulate the body. For example, "Heart meridian pattern" is a common constitutional issue, manifesting as vexation and insomnia. If you notice a habit of "protruding tongue," it may be a sign of excessive heart fire. Additionally, some people may experience "profuse urination (diabetes insipidus)" or issues with "secure the bladder and stop enuresis," which could be due to insufficient Kidney qi. Regularly massaging "extra points," such as Zusanli, can help regulate the body.

肾不纳气证与阴虚动风证是中医临床常见的两种证候，前者多表现为气短、喘息，后者则常见于手足抽搐、眩晕等症状。在治疗上，中医强调辨证施治，如肾不纳气证可采用平补平泻法，以调和肾气；阴虚动风证则需清化三焦，以平息内风。此外，气逆和秽浊也是影响健康的重要因素，气逆可能导致鼠疫等传染病的发生，而秽浊则需通过单行法进行清理，以保持体内环境的清洁与平衡。||The Kidney failing to receive qi pattern and the Yin deficiency stirring wind pattern are two common syndromes in clinical traditional Chinese medicine. The former often manifests as shortness of breath and panting, while the latter is commonly seen with symptoms such as convulsions of the hands and feet and vertigo. In treatment, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes pattern identification and treatment based on pattern differentiation. For the Kidney failing to receive qi pattern, a balanced reinforcing and reducing method can be used to harmonize the Kidney qi. For the Yin deficiency stirring wind pattern, it is necessary to clear heat and transform dampness in the triple energizer to calm the internal wind. Additionally, Qi counterflow and foul turbidity are also important factors affecting health. Qi counterflow may lead to the occurrence of infectious diseases such as bubonic plague, while foul turbidity needs to be cleared through the use of single medicine to maintain the cleanliness and balance of the internal environment.

在中医理论中，"表邪内陷"是指外邪由表入里的病理过程，常导致病情加重。针对此类病症，中医常采用"特定穴"进行针灸治疗，如温和灸法，通过温和的热力刺激穴位，调和气血，缓解症状。此外，"肾主水液"的理论指出，肾脏在调节体内水液平衡中起关键作用，因此，使用"利水渗剂"可以帮助排除体内多余水分，减轻水肿等症状。在治疗过程中，还需注意"筋惕肉瞤"的现象，即肌肉不自主的跳动，这可能是体内气血失调的表现。对于"丹痧"这类皮肤病，中医认为多由热毒引起，治疗时需清热解毒，同时调理脾胃，防止"肥气"积聚，即体内脂肪过多，影响气血运行。综上所述，中医治疗强调辨证施治，通过多种方法综合调理，达到治疗疾病的目的。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), "exterior pathogen entering the interior" refers to the pathological process where external pathogens move from the exterior to the interior, often leading to the aggravation of the disease. For such conditions, TCM often employs "the specific points" for acupuncture treatment, such as "gentle moxibustion," which uses mild heat stimulation on acupoints to "regulate and harmonize qi and blood," thereby alleviating symptoms. Additionally, the theory that "the kidney governs water and fluids" indicates that the kidney plays a crucial role in regulating the balance of water and fluids within the body. Therefore, using "diuretics" can help eliminate excess body fluids and reduce symptoms like edema. During the treatment process, attention should also be paid to the phenomenon of "muscle twitching and cramp," which may be a manifestation of "qi-blood disharmony." For skin diseases such as "scarlet fever," TCM believes they are mostly caused by heat toxins. Treatment requires "clearing heat and removing toxins," while also "regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach" to prevent the accumulation of "masses in the liver," which refers to excessive fat in the body affecting the circulation of qi and blood. In summary, TCM treatment emphasizes "pattern identification" and comprehensive regulation through various methods to achieve the goal of treating diseases.

Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that gastric ulcers are mostly caused by the waning of yin or yang and constitutional insufficiency. It is advisable to consume more ascending and floating medicines, such as ginger and tangerine peel, to help clear heat in the heart and spleen and regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach. Additionally, since teeth are the extension of the bone, dental issues may also reflect bone health, especially for patients with fixed impediment disorder. Pain in the gaohuang area should not be overlooked, and timely regulation is necessary to prevent minor ailments from developing into major diseases.

Additionally, in traditional Chinese medicine, there is a type of "emetic medicine" that can help the body expel excess toxins, but it should be used with caution. Moreover, regular "inserting manipulation" massage can help promote the circulation of Qi and Blood, ensuring that the body's "movement of all joints" is smooth. When Qi and Blood flow smoothly, the hair will naturally improve. Remember, health preservation should "follow the natural tendency downward," aligning with natural laws to achieve twice the result with half the effort!

最近天气转凉，不少朋友反映出现了皮肤瘙痒的问题，这可能是肝血瘀阻证的表现。中医认为，肝主疏泄，肝血瘀阻会导致气血运行不畅，从而引发皮肤问题。此时，可以尝试通过固涩法来调理，比如按摩一些特定的腧穴，如太冲穴、三阴交等，帮助疏通肝经气血。此外，如果伴有痰蕴肺证的症状，如咳嗽、痰多，可以考虑使用一些化痰的中药，如陈皮、半夏等。对于长期饮酒的朋友，如果出现酒臌的症状，如腹胀、食欲不振，建议及时调理，避免病情加重。最后，输刺（十二刺）中的一些方法，如浅刺、深刺，也可以根据具体情况选择使用，帮助缓解不适。希望大家都能在这个季节里保持健康，远离蜣螂蛀等皮肤问题的困扰。||Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, many friends have reported experiencing skin itch, which may be a manifestation of the liver blood stasis pattern. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is believed that the liver governs the free flow of qi, and liver blood stasis can lead to poor circulation of qi and blood, thereby causing skin issues. At this time, one can try to regulate the condition through securing and astringent methods, such as massaging specific acupuncture points like Taichong (LV3) and Sanyinjiao (SP6), to help promote the flow of qi and blood in the liver meridian. Additionally, if symptoms of phlegm obstructing the lung pattern are present, such as cough and excessive phlegm, one might consider using Chinese herbal medicines that transform phlegm, such as Chenpi (Tangerine Peel) and Banxia (Pinellia Rhizome). For friends who consume alcohol regularly, if symptoms of alcoholic tympanites appear, such as abdominal distension and poor appetite, it is advisable to seek timely regulation to prevent the condition from worsening.

在中医临床实践中，针刺异常情况是针灸治疗中常见的现象，需及时处理以避免不良反应。手针疗法作为一种传统针灸技术，广泛应用于治疗疣目等皮肤病症。六腑作为人体重要的生理系统，其功能失调常导致暴泻等消化系统疾病。针对疫毒内闭证，中医常用重镇安神剂以清热解毒、镇静安神。此外，阳虚水停证的治疗则需温阳利水，以恢复体内水液代谢平衡。这些治疗方法体现了中医辨证施治的核心理念，为患者提供了多样化的治疗选择。||In clinical practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture-related adverse events are common phenomena during acupuncture treatment and need to be promptly addressed to avoid adverse reactions. Hand acupuncture, as a traditional acupuncture technique, is widely used in treating skin diseases such as warts. The six fu organs, as important physiological systems in the human body, often lead to digestive system diseases like fulminant diarrhoea when their functions are disrupted. For the epidemic toxin blocking the heart spirit pattern, TCM commonly uses formulas that calm and settle the mind with heavy medicines to clear heat and remove toxins, as well as to calm the mind. Additionally, the treatment for yang deficiency induced water retention pattern requires tonifying yang and promoting diuresis to restore the balance of water metabolism in the body. These treatment methods embody the core concept of pattern identification and treatment in TCM, providing patients with diverse treatment options.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了脾胃不适的症状，比如食欲不振、腹胀等，这可能是**脾胃阴虚证**的表现。中医认为，**气能生血**，脾胃虚弱会导致气血不足，进而引发**脾气下陷证**，表现为乏力、头晕等。如果你发现舌苔呈现**类剥苔**，那可能是体内有**火淫证**或**风淫证**的迹象。针对这些问题，可以尝试一些经典的**验方**，比如温中健脾的方剂，帮助缓解**寒🗎入络证**引起的四肢冰冷。平时注意饮食调理，少吃生冷食物，多喝温开水，对改善体质很有帮助哦！||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many people have experienced symptoms of spleen and stomach discomfort, such as poor appetite and abdominal distension, which may be manifestations of the Yin deficiency of the spleen and stomach pattern. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that Qi engenders blood, and spleen and stomach deficiency can lead to Qi and blood deficiency, subsequently causing the Spleen qi sinking pattern, characterized by lassitude and dizziness. If you notice an exfoliated coating on the tongue, it may be a sign of the Pathogenic fire pattern or Pathogenic wind pattern in the body. To address these issues, you can try some classic empirical formulas, such as those that warm the middle and strengthen the spleen, to help alleviate the Cold dampness obstructing the meridians pattern that causes cold limbs. Pay attention to dietary adjustments in daily life, eat less raw and cold foods, and drink more warm water, which can be very helpful in improving your constitution!

最近天气转凉，不少朋友开始出现“冬温病”的症状，比如咳嗽、发热等。中医认为“肺主肃降”，肺气不畅容易导致这些症状。此外，有些人还可能出现“齿衄”的情况，这往往是脾肾不固证的表现，脾肾虚弱会导致气血失调。对于“心水病”患者，冬季更要注意保暖，避免病情加重。如果遇到“虫臌”或“狂犬病”等特殊情况，建议及时就医，不要拖延。中医治疗常采用“重方”调理，通过多味药材的组合来增强疗效。希望大家在冬季多关注身体变化，及时调理，保持健康！||Recently, as the weather turns cooler, many friends have started to exhibit symptoms of "Winter pestilence disorders," such as cough and fever. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that "the lung governs descent and purification," and the stagnation of Lung qi can easily lead to these symptoms. Additionally, some individuals may experience "gum bleeding," which is often a manifestation of the "insecurity of the spleen and kidney pattern" or "Qi deficiency of the spleen and kidney pattern," where weakness in the spleen and kidney can cause Qi-blood disharmony. For patients with "congestive heart failure," it is particularly important to stay warm in winter to avoid exacerbating the condition. In cases of special conditions such as "parasitic tympanites" or "rabies," it is advised to seek medical attention promptly without delay. TCM treatment often employs "compound formulas" for regulation, combining multiple herbs to enhance therapeutic effects. It is hoped that everyone pays attention to bodily changes during winter, adjusts in a timely manner, and maintains good health!

在中医理论中，"三阴三阳"是描述人体经络系统的重要概念，它涵盖了人体阴阳的平衡与调节。在临床实践中，通过"望诊类"技术，医生可以观察到患者的舌象变化，如"老舌"的出现，这往往是体内阴阳失衡的信号。特别是在"胞宫阳虚证"的情况下，患者可能会出现"水毒"积聚的症状，这不仅影响生殖系统的健康，还可能导致全身性的不适。此外，"荡裆"作为一种特殊的治疗手法，在调节"神气鼓荡"方面有着独特的效果，有助于恢复体内的阴阳平衡。在特定的年份，如"同岁会"时期，人体的阴阳变化更为显著，此时更需注意调养，以预防疾病的发生。通过这些中医术语的深入理解，我们可以更好地把握疾病的本质，采取有效的治疗措施。||In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, "Three yin and three yang" is an important concept describing the meridian system of the human body, encompassing the balance and regulation of Yin and Yang within the body. In clinical practice, through "Inspection" techniques, doctors can observe changes in the patient's tongue manifestations, such as the appearance of a "Tough tongue," which often signals an imbalance of Yin and Yang within the body. Particularly in cases of "Uterine yang deficiency pattern," patients may exhibit symptoms of "Cutaneous schistosomiasis" accumulation, which not only affects the health of the reproductive system but may also lead to systemic discomfort. Additionally, "Slack crotch" as a unique therapeutic method has distinctive effects in regulating "Shen-qi movement," aiding in the restoration of the body's Yin-Yang balance. During specific years, such as the "Identical annual congruence" period, the changes in the body's Yin and Yang are more pronounced, necessitating greater attention to health maintenance to prevent the onset of diseases. Through a deep understanding of these traditional Chinese medical terms, we can better grasp the essence of diseases and adopt effective treatment measures.

Wind heat affecting the meridians pattern is a typical manifestation of emotional disorders, with patients frequently experiencing symptoms such as headache, fever, and sore throat. In treatment, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes pattern identification and treatment. For patients with qi stagnation with phlegm retention pattern, methods such as soothing the liver and regulating qi, and transforming phlegm and dissipating nodules are commonly used. Additionally, stopping bleeding and securing the fetus are particularly important in gynecological diseases, especially when abnormal bleeding occurs in pregnant women, timely measures to stop bleeding are crucial for protecting fetal health. Night crying is a common sleep disorder in infants and young children, often associated with excessive heart fire or spleen-stomach disharmony, and treatment requires harmonizing the heart and spleen. Yellow-water sore is a type of skin infectious disease, commonly seen in damp-heat environments, and treatment requires clearing heat and removing toxins, reducing swelling, and alleviating pain. Cold diarrhea is a type of diarrhea caused by pathogenic cold, and treatment requires warming the middle and dispersing cold, stopping diarrhea, and consolidating the intestines.

Upon detailed inquiry, I found that she also exhibited symptoms of spleen deficiency generating wind pattern, such as cold hands and feet and a tendency to sweat easily. This reminded me of the concept of "the organ of strenuous work" mentioned in the "Inner Canon," which refers to the kidneys. The kidneys govern water metabolism and are closely related to the function of the lower jiao resembling a sluice. This patient's condition was precisely due to kidney yang deficiency leading to water metabolism disorder, which in turn affected the spleen and stomach functions. In treatment, I employed the sweating method, combined with Chinese herbal medicines that warm the kidneys and strengthen the spleen, achieving significant results. In fact, many gynecological issues are related to kidney qi deficiency, such as the common biliary ascariasis, which is also caused by kidney yang weakness. I recommend that everyone pay attention to keeping warm, especially around the waist and abdomen, to maintain the balance of the pulse rate and ensure the coordinated functioning of all zang-fu organs.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友反映出现了“干脚气”的问题，脚部皮肤干燥、脱皮，甚至伴有瘙痒。中医认为，这与体内湿气滞留、经络不畅有关，即所谓的“滞颐”。通过“循经感传”的方法，可以刺激经络，促进气血流通，缓解症状。此外，观察舌象也是中医诊断的重要手段，如果你的舌苔呈现“淡红舌”，可能提示体内有热，尤其是“心恶热”的情况。对于喜欢饮酒的朋友，要注意“酒臌”的风险，长期饮酒可能导致脾胃湿热，影响健康。脉象上，“缓脉”常提示气血不足，需要调养。平时可以多按摩“浮络”，帮助疏通经络，增强体质。希望大家在秋冬季节注意保暖，调理身体，远离不适。||Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, many friends have reported experiencing issues of "dry beriberi," characterized by dry, peeling skin on the feet, sometimes accompanied by pruritus. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) attributes this to the stagnation of dampness within the body and the obstruction of meridians and collaterals, a condition known as "dribbling disorder." By employing the method of "transmission of sensation along meridians," it is possible to stimulate the meridians and collaterals, promote the circulation of Qi and Blood, and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, observing tongue manifestations is a crucial diagnostic tool in TCM. If your tongue coating appears as a "pale red tongue," it may indicate the presence of heat within the body, particularly a condition where "the heart dislikes heat." For those who enjoy drinking alcohol, it is important to be aware of the risk of "alcoholic tympanites," as long-term alcohol consumption can lead to damp-heat in the spleen and stomach, affecting health. In terms of pulse conditions, a "slowdown pulse" often suggests a deficiency of Qi and Blood, necessitating restorative care. Regularly massaging the "floating collaterals" can help unblock the meridians and collaterals and enhance physical constitution. It is advisable to keep warm and regulate the body during the autumn and winter seasons to stay away from discomfort.

最近有不少朋友问我关于女性前阴类病的问题，尤其是那些伴随着瘀阻胞宫证的情况。其实，这类问题往往与阳明经证有关，阳明经的失调可能导致火性炎上，进而影响到肺在体合皮的功能。肺主皮毛，肺气不畅，皮肤问题也随之而来。此外，筋瘤的形成也与阳明经的瘀滞有关，尤其是明堂部位的筋瘤，常常让人感到不适。对于这类问题，中医常采用敛肺平喘的方法来调理，帮助肺气顺畅，从而缓解症状。如果你也有类似的困扰，不妨试试中医的调理方法，或许会有意想不到的效果哦！||Recently, many friends have asked me about disorders of the female external genitalia, especially those accompanied by the blood stasis obstructing the uterus pattern. In fact, such issues are often related to the Yangming meridian pattern. Dysregulation of the Yangming meridian may lead to fire flaming upward, which in turn affects the lung's function of being connected with the skin and body hair. The lung governs the skin and body hair, and when lung qi is not smooth, skin problems may arise. Additionally, the formation of sinew tumours is also related to stagnation in the Yangming meridian, particularly sinew tumours in the bright hall area, which often cause discomfort. For such issues, traditional Chinese medicine often employs methods to astringe the lung and alleviate panting to regulate lung qi, thereby relieving symptoms. If you are experiencing similar issues, you might consider trying traditional Chinese medicine's regulatory methods, which may yield unexpected results!

在中医理论中，气机不利常导致多种病理变化，如胃气上逆证，表现为恶心呕吐等症状。治疗上，开阖补泻法是调整气机的重要手段，通过调节阴阳平衡来恢复健康。燥邪犯肺证则多见于秋季，表现为干咳少痰，治疗需润燥清肺。阴寒体质者易感寒邪，需温阳散寒。暑多夹湿，夏季湿热交蒸，易引发热毒内闭证，表现为高热烦躁，需清热解毒。七方是中医治疗的基本方剂分类，根据不同证候选用相应方剂，以达到最佳治疗效果。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, impaired qi movement often leads to various pathological changes, such as the ascending of stomach qi pattern, which manifests as symptoms like nausea and vomiting. In treatment, the method of reinforcing and reducing by opening and closing is an important means to regulate qi movement, restoring health by adjusting the balance of Yin and Yang. The pattern of dryness invading the lung is commonly seen in autumn, characterized by an unproductive cough with little phlegm, and treatment requires moistening dryness and clearing the lung. Individuals with a cold uterus constitution are prone to pathogenic cold and need to warm yang and dissipate cold. Summer heat often combines with dampness, and the steaming of damp-heat in summer can easily lead to the interior heat toxin pattern, manifested as high fever and restlessness, requiring clearing heat and removing toxins. The seven formula types are the basic classification of formulas in TCM treatment, selecting the corresponding formulas based on different patterns to achieve the best therapeutic effect.

最近天气转凉，不少人开始出现凉燥病的症状，比如口干舌燥、皮肤干痒等。中医认为，这与肝气郁结、肝脾气滞证有关。肝气不畅，容易导致肝郁血虚证，表现为情绪低落、疲倦乏力。此外，牙宣问题也常与肝火旺盛有关，尤其是迟脉的人更容易出现牙龈出血。对于慢乳蛾患者，调理肝气是关键，同时要注意避免中络问题，即经络不通导致的疼痛。建议大家多喝温水，保持心情舒畅，适当按摩太冲穴，帮助疏肝理气，缓解肝脾气滞证带来的不适。||Recently, as the weather turns cooler, many people have started to exhibit symptoms of cool dryness, such as dry mouth and itchy skin. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that this is related to liver qi stagnation and qi stagnation of the liver and spleen pattern. When liver qi is not flowing smoothly, it can easily lead to liver qi stagnation with blood deficiency pattern, manifesting as low mood, lassitude, and lack of strength. Additionally, gingival recession is often associated with excessive liver fire, especially in individuals with a slow pulse, who are more prone to gum bleeding. For patients with chronic tonsillitis, regulating liver qi is key, and attention should also be paid to avoiding stroke of collaterals, which refers to pain caused by blocked meridians and collaterals. It is recommended to drink more warm water, maintain a relaxed mood, and appropriately massage the Taichong acupoint to help soothe the liver and regulate qi, alleviating the discomfort caused by qi stagnation of the liver and spleen pattern.

在中医理论中，"阳中之阴"是一个重要的概念，它描述了在阳性体质中存在的阴性特征，这种阴阳的平衡对于维持健康至关重要。例如，在治疗"丹痧"时，中医师可能会采用"刺络拔罐"的方法，这种方法通过刺激经络来调节体内的气血流动，从而达到治疗效果。此外，"横痃"作为一种常见的病症，其治疗往往需要结合"提法"和"梳法"，这两种手法分别通过提升和梳理来缓解症状。在诊断过程中，"卫气营血辨证"是一种常用的方法，它帮助医师判断疾病的性质和位置，如"里证"通常指的是内部器官的病变。通过这些综合的治疗和诊断方法，中医能够有效地处理各种复杂的健康问题。||In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), "Yin within Yang" is an important concept that describes the presence of Yin characteristics within a Yang constitution. This balance of Yin and Yang is crucial for maintaining health. For example, in treating "Scarlet fever," a TCM practitioner might employ the method of "Blood-letting and cupping," which stimulates the meridians and collaterals to regulate the flow of Qi and Blood in the body, thereby achieving therapeutic effects. Additionally, "Buboes," as a common condition, often requires a combination of "Lifting manipulation" and "Combing manipulation," which alleviate symptoms through lifting and combing techniques respectively. During the diagnostic process, "Pattern differentiation of Wei-defence, Qi, Ying nutrients, and Blood" is a commonly used method that helps practitioners determine the nature and location of diseases, such as "Interior pattern," which typically refers to pathological changes in internal organs. Through these comprehensive treatment and diagnostic methods, TCM can effectively address various complex health issues.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了“火毒内闭证”的症状，比如口干舌燥、咽喉肿痛等。这时候，可以试试“悬灸”来缓解不适，悬灸不仅能“泄热存津”，还能帮助身体“开吸合呼”，调节呼吸。对于“燥毒证”引起的皮肤干燥、便秘等问题，可以服用一些“气血两清剂”，帮助身体排毒。此外，如果感觉体内有“痰阻精室”的情况，可以适当使用“固表止汗药”来调节体内的湿气。总之，中医讲究内外兼修，通过调理身体内部的平衡，来达到健康的状态。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many people have experienced symptoms of "Interior heat toxin pattern," such as dry mouth and sore throat. At this time, one can try "Suspended moxibustion" to alleviate discomfort. Suspended moxibustion not only "clears heat and generates fluids" but also helps the body "open with breathing in and close with breathing out," regulating respiration. For issues like dry skin and constipation caused by "Dryness toxin pattern," one can take some "Formulas that clear heat in the qi and blood" to help the body detoxify. Additionally, if one feels that there is "Phlegm obstructing the essence chamber pattern" in the body, it is appropriate to use "Exterior-securing and sweat-stopping medicines" to regulate internal dampness. In summary, Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes both internal and external cultivation, achieving a healthy state by regulating the body's internal balance.

在中医理论中，"肺在体合皮"强调了肺与皮肤的密切关系，肺气充足则皮肤光泽。当出现"胃阴亏虚证"时，患者常表现为口干舌燥、食欲不振，此时需滋阴养胃。"肝黄"则指肝脏功能失调导致的黄疸现象，常见于肝胆疾病。此外，"五色"理论在中医诊断中占有重要地位，通过观察面色、舌色等五色变化，可以判断脏腑功能状态。例如，"颧红"常提示阴虚火旺。对于"鼻痔"的治疗，中医多采用"燥🗎行滞"的方法，以清热燥湿、行气活血为主。在针灸治疗中，"一夫法"是一种常用的取穴方法，通过手指宽度来确定穴位位置，简便易行。这些中医术语和理论为我们理解人体健康提供了独特的视角。||In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, "The outer aspect of the lung is the skin" emphasizes the close relationship between the lung and the skin. When lung qi is sufficient, the skin appears lustrous. When the "Stomach yin deficiency pattern" occurs, patients often present with dry mouth and poor appetite, necessitating the nourishment of yin and the stomach. "Liver jaundice" refers to the jaundice phenomenon caused by liver dysfunction, commonly seen in liver and gallbladder diseases. Additionally, the "Five colours" theory holds an important position in TCM diagnosis, where observing changes in facial and tongue colours can help determine the functional state of the Zang–fu organs. For instance, "Red cheeks" often indicate yin deficiency leading to fire hyperactivity. In the treatment of "Nasal polyps," TCM often employs methods to "Dry dampness and circulate qi," focusing on clearing heat, drying dampness, and promoting qi and blood circulation. In acupuncture treatment, the "Four-finger measurement" is a commonly used method for locating acupoints, determining their positions based on the width of fingers, making it simple and practical. These TCM terms and theories provide unique perspectives on understanding human health.

Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes the "Diagnosis methods using the three positions and nine indicators," and only through comprehensive observation can accurate symptoms for provisional diagnosis be made. For example, some people may feel discomfort in the throat, which could be a manifestation of oesophageal achalasia. In such cases, one might try methods to transform dampness and harmonize the middle jiao. There are also inquiries about liver pestilence and non-sequential meridian transmission, which are more complex diseases in TCM and require professional doctors to perform pattern identification and treatment. In summary, during the autumn and winter seasons, it is important to keep warm, engage in appropriate exercise, and maintain good daily routines to stay away from these minor ailments!

Paediatric smallpox is a common infectious disease in children, and TCM believes its causative factors are often related to the fetal toxin and heat accumulation pattern, where the heat toxin accumulated by the mother during pregnancy is transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. Qi failing to transform thin fluids refers to the obstruction of the generation and distribution of body fluids due to impaired Qi movement, commonly seen in patients with chronic diseases. Circulating blood and resolving stagnation is an important principle in TCM for treating blood stasis due to Qi stagnation, alleviating symptoms by promoting blood circulation and Qi movement. Tinea corporis and hypothyroidism are two different skin diseases; the former is often caused by damp-heat accumulation, while the latter is related to Qi and blood deficiency. Filariasis is a disease caused by parasites, and TCM treatment often employs methods such as clearing heat to detoxify and circulating blood to transform stasis. In summary, TCM emphasizes holistic regulation and pattern differentiation in treating these diseases to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and root.

Cold tends to impair yang, meaning that pathogenic cold easily damages the body's yang qi, leading to symptoms such as cold intolerance and cold limbs. The lung regulates waterways, and dysfunction of lung qi can affect water metabolism, resulting in issues like edema and oliguria. Yuan-primordial points are important acupoints in the meridians and collaterals, and stimulating these points can regulate the functions of the zang-fu organs. Circulating blood and relaxing tendons are commonly used to treat pain and muscle stiffness caused by static blood. Fright palpitation disorder is often due to deficiency of heart qi or disturbance of the spirit, presenting as palpitations and insomnia. Vulvar ulceration refers to chronic inflammation of the female external genitalia, requiring nourishing yin and clearing heat. The yin and yang deficiency pattern is characterized by dual deficiency of yin and yang, commonly seen in chronic disease patients, necessitating nourishing both yin and yang.

Clinical observations have shown that patients with Frozen Shoulder often experience symptoms of Muscle Cramp Disorder, indicating local stagnation of Qi and Blood. Additionally, this study found that the onset of Frozen Shoulder is related to the pathological state of Yin Excess Leading to Cold, further validating the TCM theory that "Cold leads to contraction". Meanwhile, this study also compared the similarities and differences in the pathogenesis of Frozen Shoulder with Epidemic Cholera, Leprosy, and Mouth Ulcer, finding that the pathological changes of Frozen Shoulder are mainly manifested as local stagnation of Qi and Blood, while Epidemic Cholera, Leprosy, and Mouth Ulcer involve more systemic Qi-Blood Disharmony. In summary, the pathogenesis of Frozen Shoulder is closely related to the Qi and Blood circulation in the Fifteen Collaterals and is associated with the pathological state of Yin Excess Leading to Cold, providing new insights for clinical treatment.

It is also important to pay attention to diet, consuming more foods that moisten the intestine and clear heat, such as pears and honey, to help detoxify the body. Additionally, the rushing gate, which is the upper opening of the stomach, if dysfunctional, may also cause discomfort, so stomach-protecting techniques are also crucial. Finally, TCM emphasizes "opening the orifices and unblocking impediments," and appropriate tuina or acupuncture can help to dredge the meridians and collaterals, relieving headaches. Of course, the tonifying method is also a good way to regulate the body; proper supplementation can enhance physical fitness and prevent diseases.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that it is mostly caused by the internal accumulation of damp-heat toxic pathogens. In treatment, fire cupping can be used to eliminate toxic pathogens, combined with the upper and lower point combination method, selecting specific points for acupuncture to dredge the meridians and collaterals and regulate and harmonize qi and blood. For patients with chronic hoarseness, TCM emphasizes the importance of regulating and harmonizing the liver and spleen, improving symptoms by soothing the liver and regulating qi, and strengthening the spleen to resolve dampness. Additionally, stony tonsillitis, as a throat disease, is often accompanied by a grey coating. Treatment requires pattern differentiation of cold dampness affecting the low back pattern, with the principle of warming yang and dissipating cold, and resolving phlegm to clear the throat. Comprehensive application of these methods can effectively alleviate symptoms and promote recovery.

在中医理论中，"肾其华在发"强调了肾脏与头发健康的密切关系，而"五脏化液"则揭示了五脏在体液代谢中的核心作用。针对"痰火蕴肺证"，中医常用"解毒消肿"的方法来缓解症状，同时"消食化滞"也是治疗消化不良的重要手段。对于"寒包火"这一特殊病理状态，中医主张通过"补脾益肺"来调和体内阴阳，而"膀胱热证"则需清热利湿以恢复膀胱功能。这些理论不仅体现了中医的整体观念，也为临床治疗提供了丰富的思路。||In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, "The lustre of the kidney shows in the hair" emphasizes the close relationship between the kidney and hair health, while "Fluids of the five zang organs" reveals the core role of the five zang organs in body fluid metabolism. For the "Phlegm heat accumulating in the lung pattern," traditional Chinese medicine commonly uses the method of "Remove toxins and resolve swelling" to alleviate symptoms, and "Promote digestion and eliminate stagnation" is also an important approach for treating indigestion. For the special pathological state of "Cold enveloping fire," traditional Chinese medicine advocates harmonizing the Yin and Yang within the body through "Tonify the spleen and benefit the lung," while the "Heat pattern" of the bladder requires clearing heat and promoting diuresis to restore bladder function. These theories not only embody the holistic concept of traditional Chinese medicine but also provide a wealth of ideas for clinical treatment.

最近天气变化无常，很多人反映眼睛干涩、疲劳，这可能是“目系”出了问题。中医认为，眼睛与肝脏密切相关，肝火旺盛或“神气不足”都会影响视力。此外，有些小朋友出现“奶麻”症状，皮肤起红疹，这往往是体内“水火不济”导致的。建议平时多喝些“清热生津”的饮品，比如菊花茶或梨汤，帮助调节体内平衡。如果感觉“睥虚如球”，肚子胀气不舒服，可以试试“滋养安神剂”来调理脾胃。还有朋友抱怨“无汗”，这可能是体表寒湿过重，建议适当运动，促进排汗排毒。总之，养生要顺应自然，内外兼修才能健康无忧！||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many people have reported experiencing dry and fatigued eyes, which may indicate issues with "the eye connections." Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that the eyes are closely related to the liver, and excessive liver fire or "insufficiency of spirit" can affect vision. Additionally, some children have shown symptoms of "roseola infantum," characterized by red rashes on the skin, often caused by "disharmony between the heart and the kidney" within the body. It is recommended to consume more beverages that "clear heat and generate fluids," such as chrysanthemum tea or pear soup, to help regulate the body's balance. If one feels "non-inflammatory oedema of the eyelid" and experiences abdominal bloating and discomfort, they may try "formulas that calm and nourish the mind" to regulate and harmonize the spleen and stomach. Some friends have also complained about "absence of sweating," which may be due to excessive cold-dampness on the body surface. It is advised to engage in appropriate exercise to promote sweating and detoxification. In summary, health preservation should align with nature, and both internal and external cultivation are essential for maintaining health and well-being!
