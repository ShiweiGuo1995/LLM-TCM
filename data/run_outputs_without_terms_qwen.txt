Methods The HPLC method was used to establish the fingerprint profiles of traditional decoction and formula granules of Sangju drink. The chemical composition differences between traditional decoction and formula granules were analyzed from four aspects: types of chemical components, similarity of fingerprint profiles, chemometric analysis, and content of representative marker components. Results The similarity of fingerprint profiles of ten batches of traditional decoction was all >0.988, with 35 characteristic peaks identified, and 12 common peaks were identified (peak 7 was neochlorogenic acid, peak 10 was chlorogenic acid, peak 11 was cryptochlorogenic acid, peak 13 was 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, peak 17 was rutin, peak 19 was forsythoside A, peak 20 was luteolin glycoside, peak 24 was isochlorogenic acid B, peak 25 was 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, peak 31 was forsythiaside, peak 32 was linarin, and peak 35 was ammonium glycyrrhizinate). The similarity of fingerprint profiles of formula granules was all >0.983, with 29 characteristic peaks identified. Compared with traditional decoction, some batches of formula granules lacked peaks 14, 26, 27, 30, 32, and 34. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis could distinguish the two. The contents of marker components such as neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythoside A, gentiobioside, isochlorogenic acid B, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythiaside, and linarin in traditional decoction were higher than those in formula granules, while the contents of rutin and ammonium glycyrrhizinate in formula granules were higher than those in traditional decoction. Conclusion There are differences in component types and contents between formula granules and traditional decoction of Sangju drink. The combination of fingerprint profiles and chemometric analysis can effectively evaluate the differences between traditional decoction and formula granules of Sangju drink, laying the foundation for the quality control and clinical rational application of formula granules of Sangju drink.

女性宫颈癌的发生与高危型人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染关系密切，及时有效地阻断高危型 HPV 感染对预防宫颈癌的发生有重要意义。黄元御的“一气周流”理论思想崇尚中土，注重整体气机的调畅，可阐释女性的生理病理。而高危型 HPV 感染的发生与中焦脾土失运，气机周流不畅，机体抗邪能力低下致清浊升降失常有关。基于“一气周流”理论结合“治未病”思想，笔者提出“未病先防，调畅中土存正气”“既病防变，升降相因祛毒邪”“瘥后防复，阴阳平衡和气血”的高危型 HPV 感染的防治原则，以期为临床治疗提供参考。||The occurrence of cervical cancer in women is closely related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and timely and effective interruption of high-risk HPV infection is of great significance for the prevention of cervical cancer. Huang Yuanyu's "one qi circulation" theoretical thought values the central earth, focusing on the overall regulation of qi movement, which can explain the physiology and pathology of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is associated with the dysfunction of spleen-earth transportation in the middle-jiao, the unsmooth circulation of qi movement, and the decrease in the body's ability to resist evil, leading to abnormal rising and falling of clear and turbid substances. Based on the "one qi circulation" theory combined with the "treating before disease" concept, the author proposes the preventive and therapeutic principles for high-risk HPV infection: "preventing before disease by regulating the central earth to maintain righteous qi," "preventing disease transformation after onset by treating the rising and falling interdependence to eliminate toxic evil," and "preventing recurrence after recovery by balancing yin and yang and harmonizing qi and blood," aiming to provide reference for clinical treatment.

The pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by deficiency of heart qi and heart yang, and long-term dysfunction of the triple energizer's qi transformation, which later progresses from deficiency to excess, showing a mixture of deficiency and excess symptoms. Poria cocos, Cinnamon twigs, Atractylodes macrocephala, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis decoction (referred to as Linggui Shutigan Decoction) exerts its effects through the "four-in-one" approach: the nature of the formula is pungent-sweet and warm, with a bland-sweet and bitter taste; pungent-sweet warmth transforms qi and promotes diuresis, supports yang and eliminates phlegm-dampness; bland bitterness penetrates and dries dampness, and regulates water passages; the position of the formula is in the heart, spleen, and triple energizer, invigorating heart yang, strengthening the spleen and eliminating phlegm-dampness, regulating the water passages of the triple energizer; the momentum of the formula is simultaneous upward and downward action, internal and external adjustment, promoting urination below and promoting exterior and replenishing interior, thereby facilitating the water passages of the triple energizer through momentum; the evidence of the formula is deficiency of heart yang and flooding of water-phlegm, commonly used in treating heart diseases caused by upward surging water qi. Dysfunction of the triple energizer and recurrent episodes of CHF are causally interrelated. Linggui Shutigan Decoction can warm the fire of qi transformation in the triple energizer and unblock the channels of qi transformation in the triple energizer, playing a role in addressing generalized fluid retention in CHF; its pharmacological actions include anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of myocardial cell membrane ion channels, anti-ischemia reperfusion injury, and regulation of vasodilation and vasoconstriction. Deconstructing Linggui Shutigan Decoction from the perspective of the "four-in-one" and discussing its therapeutic mechanism for CHF using the theory of "triple energizer qi transformation" is of significant importance for rejuvenating the vitality of classical prescriptions and their precise and effective application.

Methods The medical records from the chapters "Phlegm and Fluid Retention," "Phlegm and Dyspnea," and "Liver Wind and Phlegm Fire" in "Wang Xugao's Clinical Medical Cases" were used to establish a database. All Chinese herbal medicines were analyzed for frequency, flavor, and meridian tropism using Excel 2017 software. For herbs with a frequency ≥10, association rule analysis based on the Apriori algorithm was conducted using IBM SPSS Modeler 18 software, and cluster analysis based on the Ochiai algorithm was performed using SPSS 25.0 software. Results A total of 80 medical records involving 114 prescriptions and 191 Chinese herbs were included. Commonly used herbs mainly included Poria (Fuling), Pinellia (Banxia), Citrus Peel (Chenpi), Atractylodes (Baizhu), Bitter Apricot Kernel (Kuxingren), etc. The nature of the herbs used by Wang Xugao was primarily warm, followed by cold and neutral. The flavors were mainly sweet, bitter, and pungent, and the herbs primarily affected the Lung, Spleen, Stomach, Liver, and Kidney meridians. Association rule analysis identified core herb pairs such as Winter Heliotrope (Kuan Dong Hua) - Bitter Apricot Kernel (Kuxingren), Pinellia (Banxia) - Dried Ginger (Gan Jiang), Uncaria (Gouteng) - Stone决明 (Shijueming), etc. Cluster analysis yielded 8 core drug combinations. Conclusion When treating phlegm and fluid retention diseases, Wang Xugao emphasized treating multiple organs simultaneously to coordinate the balance among them, attaching importance to the complexity of causes such as cold, fire, and dampness accompanying phlegm and fluid retention. He focused on supporting the healthy qi to expel pathogenic factors and regulating the San Jiao to unblock the flow of qi. Treatment often involved treating the three jiaos together, warming yang to transform phlegm, clearing the liver to subdue wind, using sweet-warm herbs with auxiliary bitter-pungent ones.

Compared to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) internal treatment methods, TCM external treatment methods for UP are more convenient to operate, have rapid effects, and can avoid the first-pass effect caused by oral drugs as well as potential liver and kidney damage. The main treatment methods include external washing with Chinese herbal medicine, medicated baths, fumigation and washing, wet compresses, enemas, Gua Sha, acupuncture, ear acupressure, application of herbal medicine on acupoints, iontophoresis on acupoints, and autologous blood injection at acupoints. Currently, most studies add TCM external treatment methods based on conventional Western medical treatments, which can improve efficacy and have certain advantages in improving symptoms of itching, inflammatory indicators, sleep quality, and anxiety-depression status; some studies use indicators such as parathyroid hormone, serum phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, and β2-microglobulin to evaluate efficacy, suggesting that TCM external treatment methods can improve patients' micro-inflammatory status and protect renal function, but their mechanisms need further research. Existing studies have the following issues: inconsistency in clinical efficacy evaluation scales makes it difficult to compare and summarize results horizontally; relief of itching symptoms relies heavily on scale evaluations, making them relatively subjective; short study durations prevent assessment of long-term efficacy and safety; some studies do not specify patient syndrome types, making it hard to demonstrate the advantages of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, among other issues. Further improvements are needed.

"Awakening the brain and opening the orifices" is at the core of the theory of regulating the spirit, established on the principles of awakening the brain, awakening the spirit, and regulating the spirit, its theory of regulating the spirit being inseparable from the diagnosis and treatment of TCM brain diseases. Considering the characteristics of acupuncture therapy and the complexity and uniqueness of TCM brain diseases, acupuncture treatment of brain pathology should have its own unique system of diagnosis and treatment. In the process of acupuncture practice, the diagnosis and treatment of TCM brain diseases should take the "brain" as the foundation, with the general principle of "awakening and regulating the spirit," and be adapted from the main acupoints of the "awakening the brain and opening the orifices needling technique," combined with corresponding methods for different brain diseases.

Methods Retrieving clinical research literatures on TCM treatment of SAP from CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP Database, and SinoMed up to February 28, 2022, using Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, and SPSS Statistics 22.0 software for frequency statistics, cluster analysis, and association rule analysis on Chinese herbal medicine data, summarizing core prescriptions. Results A total of 289 prescriptions involving 185 types of Chinese herbs and 38 types of TCM syndromes were included. Based on the overall study of "disease" in SAP, the main drugs used in clinical treatment of SAP are blood-activating and stasis-resolving drugs, qi-supplementing and righteousness-supporting drugs, and qi-regulating and phlegm-transforming drugs. The commonly used Chinese herbs include Chuanxiong Rhizome, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Astragali Radix, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, etc.; common drug pairs include Chuanxiong Rhizome-Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Chuanxiong Rhizome-Carthami Flos, Chuanxiong Rhizome-Zizyphi Fructus, etc. Drug complex network diagram and cluster analysis show that Bazhen Decoction is the basic formula for treating SAP; based on the study of "syndrome" in SAP, Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, phlegm-blood stasis interconnection syndrome, and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome are more common TCM syndromes in SAP, all with warm or neutral properties; flavors are mainly sweet, pungent, and bitter, mostly belonging to the liver, spleen, lung, and heart meridians. Among them, Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome takes Bazhen Decoction as the basic formula composed of high-frequency drugs such as Astragali Radix, Chuanxiong Rhizome, and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma; phlegm-blood stasis interconnection syndrome often uses Gualou Xiebai Banxia Decoction combined with Taohong Siwu Decoction as the basic formula composed of high-frequency drugs such as Pinelliae Rhizoma Prepared, Chuanxiong Rhizome, and Allii Fistulosi Bulbus; qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome takes Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction as the basic formula composed of high-frequency drugs such as Chuanxiong Rhizome, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, and Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium. Cluster analysis of drugs shows that Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome can be divided into 3 categories, while phlegm-blood stasis interconnection syndrome can be divided into 4 categories. Conclusion Deficiency, stasis, phlegm, and stagnation are important pathological factors in SAP, among which qi deficiency is the basis of onset, and blood stasis runs through the entire disease, possibly accompanied by phlegm turbidity and qi stagnation. Clinical treatment often focuses on qi-supplementing drugs and blood-activating and stasis-resolving drugs according to syndrome differentiation.

According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, stroke primarily results from "deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, blood stasis, and qi" and when pathogenic factors congeal and obstruct the meridians, it leads to stagnation of qi and blood, damage to sinews and muscles, resulting in stroke flaccidity. Therefore, the main treatment method should focus on unblocking the meridians and softening the sinews. Fire needle therapy for stroke flaccidity has the effect of unblocking meridians, warming yang, softening sinews, and relieving pain, which can warm yang and dispel cold, nourish the meridians and qi, release the knots of sinews and meridians, promote the circulation of qi and blood, and nourish the limbs and all body parts. Fire needle therapy can promote the recovery of neural pathways, enhance local metabolism, improve local muscle tone, and thus restore limb function. High-quality clinical studies, selection rules of acupoints, and standardized operational techniques for treating flaccidity after stroke with fire needles require further development.

Among these, regulating qi and blood together should adopt different treatments for deficiency and excess; if deficiency is predominant, body and function should be combined to regulate and supplement qi and blood, commonly using Shuanghe Powder; if excess is predominant, dynamic and static combination should be used to unblock and smooth the circulation of blood, commonly using Huangqi Chifeng Decoction and Yueju Pills. Promoting clarity and descending turbidity should appropriately rotate qi movement and balance tonification and purgation, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate qi and resolve depression, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to tonify qi and promote clarity, Zhishu Decoction and Zhishi Pill to eliminate turbidity and remove filth.

五善七恶是一种判断中医外科疾病预后的理论，被诸多中医古籍提及，为历代外科医家重视，但现代文献对其论述较少。五善七恶首见于《太平圣惠方》，其理论源自《灵枢·玉版》中的“逆顺”。五善七恶经过历代医家的发挥，衍生出诸多变体。通过梳理历代医籍对五善七恶的记载，发现主要版本有两大类：一是《太平圣惠方》版及其衍生版（痘疹五善七恶、五善七恶救援法等）；二是《外科正宗》版及其衍生版。||Wushan qichong is a theory for predicting the prognosis of external diseases in traditional Chinese medicine, mentioned in many ancient TCM texts and valued by medical practitioners throughout history, but rarely discussed in modern literature. First seen in "Taiping Shenghui Fang," its theory originates from the "reverse and順" in "Ling Shu·Juban." After generations of development by medical scholars, many variants have emerged. By reviewing the records of Wushan Qichong in historical medical texts, it was found that there are mainly two major versions: one is the version of "Taiping Shenghui Fang" and its derivatives (such as Douchuan Wushan Qichong, Wushan Qichong rescue method, etc.); the other is the version of "Waike Zhengzong" and its derivatives.

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。||Systematic collation of Longdan Xiegan Decoction in medical books throughout the dynasties reveals that the original Longdan Xiegan Decoction recorded in "Lan Shi Mi Cang" mainly targeted diseases of male genital odor, after Xue Ji's modifications and changes, the main therapeutic scope gradually expanded, leading to issues such as confusion in the name, composition, and origin of the prescription, which is particularly prominent in "Jing Yue Quan Shu" and "Yi Fang Ji Jie". Previous medical practitioners mostly interpreted this prescription from the perspective of zang-fu organs, switching the perspective to meridians for re-interpretation might better understand the main therapeutic rules of Longdan Xiegan Decoction. The diseases of the anterior genitals are attributed to the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian, while costal pain, deafness, and other diseases are attributed to the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, and medication is adjusted according to the condition, which is not only conducive to a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the prescription to achieve accurate clinical diagnosis and medication, but also promotes modern researchers to reconsider the important role of the meridian theory in the formation and development of the entire TCM theoretical system.

《本草纲目》作为明代代表性本草著作，书中所附植物图像以另一种形式保留了李时珍对药材基原植物的考证结果，真实反映了明代对药物与植物的认识与利用情况。以书中木部香木类植物图像为例，通过考证图像所绘植物基原，以揭示明代对植物知识与药物性质的认识水平。木部香木类所载的 25 幅图像中，20 幅图像准确描述了植物的叶花及果实等，杉图对植物三尖杉形态细节的表述等均证明了明代对植物形态与药物性质认识处于较高水平。但乌药、阿魏等共 5 图的错误也说明明代对植物形态的认识仍有局限之处。通过图像考证结果与文字所载药性对比可知，明代对药性的了解程度已然鞭辟着里，对部分植物的药性认识甚至高于对其形态的了解。||As a representative work of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty, the plant images attached in "Compendium of Materia Medica" preserve in another form Li Shizhen's examination results of the original plants of medicinal materials, truly reflecting the understanding and utilization of drugs and plants in the Ming Dynasty. Taking the images of woody plants in the fragrant wood category as an example, by examining the original plants depicted in the images, it is possible to reveal the level of understanding of plant knowledge and drug properties in the Ming Dynasty. Among the 25 images of woody plants in the fragrant wood category, 20 accurately describe the leaves, flowers, fruits, etc., of the plants, and the expression of the morphological details of Cephalotaxus in the cedar image all prove that the understanding of plant morphology and drug properties in the Ming Dynasty was at a high level. However, the errors in 5 images, such as those of Lindera and Ferula, also indicate that there were still limitations in the understanding of plant morphology in the Ming Dynasty. By comparing the results of image examination with the recorded properties of drugs in the text, it can be known that the understanding of drug properties in the Ming Dynasty had already reached a profound level, and the understanding of the properties of some plants even exceeded their understanding of morphology.

通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。||By comparing the relevant texts from excavated and transmitted documents, the treatment details of "Stone Boil" in "The Verification of Qi and Spirit by Five Colors and Meridians" from the Medical Texts Unearthed at Tianhui are analyzed, elucidating its connection with the theories in extant medical classics. Compared to the stone puncture methods in the "Pulse Methods" from Mawangdui and the "Pulse Texts" from Zhangjiashan, the method of using "stone god" to treat carbuncles and boils in the Medical Texts Unearthed at Tianhui can prevent the progression of the disease before the blood accumulates and pus forms, achieving the effect of "definitely cured". Additionally, the diagnostic and therapeutic methods related to stone boil may have inspired the concept of "regulating spirit" and the theory of treating diseases before they occur in later generations.
