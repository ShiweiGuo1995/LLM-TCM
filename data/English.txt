The occurrence of cervical cancer in women is closely related to high-risk HPV infection, and timely and effective interruption of high-risk HPV infection is of great significance to prevent the occurrence of cervical cancer. Huang Yuanyou's theory of "circular flow of Qi" emphasizes on the harmonization of the overall Qi flow, which can explain the physiopathology of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is related to the loss of spleen and earth transportation in the middle Jiao, poor circulation of Qi, and the low resistance of the body to evil, resulting in the malfunctioning of clear and turbid. Based on the theory of "circular flow of Qi" combined with the idea of "prevention treatment of disease", the author proposes to "prevent the disease before it occurs, regulate the middle earth to preserve the correct Qi" and "prevent the disease before it occurs". The principles of prevention and treatment of high-risk HPV infection are "prevent before the disease, regulate the middle earth to preserve the righteousness", "promote and descend to dispel the poisonous evil", and "prevent recurrence after the disease, balance yin and yang and harmonize Qi and blood", in order to provide reference for clinical treatment.

The "four-in-one" approach is based on the four-dimensional perspective of "property, position, tendency and syndrome", which helps to identify and analyze classical prescriptions in a multi-dimensional and three-dimensional way. The early pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) is deficiency of heart Qi and heart Yang and disorder in Qi transformation in triple energizer, while in the later stage of the disease, it progresses from deficiency to excess, with simultaneous occurrence of deficiency and excess syndromes. Fuling Guizhi Baizhu Gancao Decoction (Linggui Zhugan Decoction) plays its role in treating chronic heart failure by the four elements of "property, position, tendency and syndrome". Property—Linggui Zhugan Decoction is pungent, sweet, slight sweet and bitter in flavor, but warm in property. The sweet is able to tonify deficiency; the pungent is responsible for dispersing Yang, promoting Qi and draining water retention; the warm nourishes the spleen, raises Yang Qi and resolves phlegm; the bitter could excrete diuresis and dry dampness to guarantee the smooth operation of three energizer. Position-Linggui Zhugan Decoction acts on the heart, spleen and triple energizer. It can stimulate heart Yang, strengthen the spleen, resolve phlegm, and regulate the waterways to promote the Qi transformation in triple energizer. Tendency-The tendency of Linggui Zhugan Decoction is upward and downward in parallel, both internal and external. Warming up and promoting diuresis, raising Yang up and tonifying deficiency, it is conducive to the Yang Qi transformation in triple energizer. Syndrome-Linggui Zhugan Decoction is indicated for the syndrome of heart Yang deficiency and water-fluid retention, which begins with the upper abdomen swelling, Qi rushes against the chest. It is widely used in the treatment of water-vapor impulse heart disease. The disorder of Qi transformation in triple energizer is the main mechanism of recurrent CHF. Linggui Zhugan Decoction can not only warm the fire of Qi transformation in triple energizer, but also smooth the pathway of Qi transformation in triple energizer, which is compatible with the treatment of systemic fluid retention in chronic heart failure. Its pharmacological mechanisms include anti-inflammation, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of cardiomyocyte cell membrane ion channels, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury and modulation of vasodilation, etc. Deconstructing Linggui Zhugan Decoction with "four-in-one" approach and discussing its mechanism for treating CHF in combination with the theory of "Qi transformation in triple energizer", have great significance to rejuvenate the vitality of classical prescriptions and to apply them accurately and effectively.

Uremic pruritus (UP) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, which seriously reduces the quality of life of patients. Compared with the internal treatment of TCM, the external treatment of TCM for UP is simpler and more effective, and can avoid the first pass effect caused by oral drugs and may cause liver and kidney damage. The treatment methods mainly include external washing of TCM, medicated bath, fumigation, wet compress, enema, scraping, acupuncture, auricular point sticking, acupoint application, acupoint iontophoresis, autologous blood acupoint injection and so on. At present, most studies are based on the conventional treatment of Western medicine, and the addition of external treatment of TCM can improve the efficacy, and has certain advantages in improving itching symptoms, inflammatory indicators, sleep quality, anxiety and depression. Some studies have selected parathyroid hormone, blood phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, β2-microglobulin and other indicators to evaluate the efficacy. The results suggest that external treatment of TCM can improve the micro-inflammatory state of patients and protect renal function, but further mechanism research is needed. The existing research has the following problems: the clinical efficacy evaluation scale is not uniform, and it is difficult to compare and summarize horizontally; the relief of pruritus symptoms is based on the scale evaluation, which is subjective; the course of treatment is short, and the long-term efficacy and safety can not be evaluated; some studies do not specify the patients' syndrome type, which is difficult to reflect the advantages of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, and needed to be improved in the future.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the common chronic complication of diabetes, which can lead to foot ulcers, gangrene, and amputation in severe cases, seriously affecting their quality of life. DPN belongs to the category of "arthralgia", "hemorrhoids" and other categories of TCM, and the main pathogenesis is the deficiency of qi and blood, yin and yang, and the obstruction of the meridians by phlegm and stasis. Clinically, DPN is more common with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome. Based on the theory of "qi meridian constant communication" in the Huang Di Nei Jing, this article proposed that for patients with DPN with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, the treatment should be based on the principle of "invigorating qi and activating blood circulation, dissolving stasis and arthralgia", so that the patients' qi meridian can be accessible, delay the disease progression, and provide reference for the TCM treatment of DPN.

Depression after myocardial infarction is closely related to the theory of ascending and descending of qi and blood. The core pathogenesis is analyzed as disorder of qi and blood, mental damage, uncontrolled upward and downward movement, and pivot movement failure. The treatment method is to regulate qi and blood, invigorate qi and activate blood circulation and restore the rise and fall of visceral qi. Nourishing qi and promoting blood circulation should invigorate qi in the first. Appropriate blood activating drugs should be selected according to the degree of blood stasis, so that the blood circulation is smooth and the spirit has dependence. The key to restoring the normal balance of qi movement of visceral organs is to regulate not only liver ascending and lung descending but also spleen. Clinicians need pay attention to the nature of drug lifting and falling, conforming the physiological functions of the organs, to restore the rising and falling of the qi movement of internal organs.

Tripterygium wilfordii is widely used in the treatment of autoimmune system diseases, but its obvious reproductive toxicity limits the clinical application and promotion of the drug. At present, there is no clear solution to the reproductive injury of Tripterygium wilfordii. TCM believes that its reproductive toxicity lies in its properties of pungent, bitter, and cold. Long-term use can dry liver and blood, hurt liver and yang, consume kidney essence, damage kidney and yang, destroy the balance of qi and blood, yin and yang in the internal organs, and cause infertility. Based on the relationship between liver and kidney and human reproductive function, this article proposed to understand the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii from the perspective of "Yi and Gui homology", and explored the method of reducing the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii according to the thought of "treating liver and kidney together", in order to expand the theoretical thinking of TCM for the safe clinical application of this drug.

Based on the theory of collateral disease, it is believed that the invasion of evil into the lung collaterals and the internalization of cancer toxin gradually form "stagnant collaterals," "exuberant collaterals," and "deficient collaterals," which are similar to the abnormal vascular network formed by tumor cells. They can evolve into hypoxic, inflammatory, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, affecting the treatment effect of lung cancer. Combining the biological characteristics of tumors, based on Ye Tianshi's view of "collaterals are used for their通畅," corresponding methods of activating blood and collaterals, detoxifying collaterals, and invigorating Qi and collaterals can be applied. The flexible use of hemostatic, detoxic, and tonifying drugs can target the regulation of hypoxic environment, inflammatory state, and immune response, which is helpful for inducing the normalization of tumor vessels and reshaping the tumor microenvironment. While improving the efficacy of combined treatment, it can also reduce adverse reactions and improve patient tolerance.

Stroke flaccid paralysis is stroke patients with abnormal physical movement function and muscle tone decline as the main performance and is a kind of common pathological state after apoplectic stroke. The longer the flaccid paralysis is, the worse the prognosis. The theory of TCM holds that stroke is mainly due to "deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, stasis, qi", and when the pathogenic factor accumulate and block the meridians, which would cause blood stagnation, muscle and tendon damage and flaccidity, resulting in stroke paralysis. Therefore, it is necessary to set up the "Tongjing Roujin" (stimulating the muscle and nourishing the tendon) as its main treatment. Fire-needling has the effect of stimulating muscle, warming yang, nourishing tendon, and relieving pain in the treatment of stroke flaccid paralysis. It can warm yang and dissipate cold, replenish and nourish meridian qi, release muscle nodules, promote the circulation of qi and blood, and nourish all limbs and bones. Fire-needling therapy can promote the recovery of neural pathway, strengthen local metabolism, improve local muscle tension, and thus restore limb function. The high-quality clinical research, acupoint selection rules, and standardized operating techniques of fire-needling treatment for stroke flaccid paralysis need to be further deepened.

Clinically, the concept of "heart of blood vessels" and "heart of spirit" in traditional Chinese medicine can be used to understand the dual-heart disease, grasp the core pathogenesis of "disharmony of Qi and blood, and distinction of pure and turbid", inherit and innovate Mr. Pu Fuzhu's academic thought of "smoothing Qi and blood, emphasizing ascending and descending", as well as the "harmony thought" of the national medical master Xue Boshou. Starting from the essence of the dual-heart disorder, the core treatment method is "regulating Qi and blood together, ascending the clear and descending the turbid". Among them, the regulation of Qi and blood should be treated differently according to deficiency and excess. If deficiency is the main issue, the combination of body and use should be used to regulate and supplement Qi and blood, and the commonly used prescription is Shuanghe Powder. If excess is the main issue, a combination of movement and stillness should be used to unblock the blood vessels, and commonly used prescriptions are Astragalus and Red Wind Soup, and Yueju Pill. Ascending the clear and descending the turbid should focus on regulating the Qi mechanism and appropriate supplementation and purgation, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate Qi and relieve depression, Buzhong Yiqi Tang to supplement Qi and ascend the clear, and Zhishi Tang and Zhishi Pill to eliminate the turbid and expel the dirt.

The clinical manifestations of colorectal polyps are consistent with the characteristics of dampness, stickiness and heaviness. The TCM constitutions in the prone population are mostly related to dampness. The pathological changes of intestinal flora imbalance, intestinal micro inflammation, neuroendocrine immune network and abnormal aquaporin in colorectal polyps are consistent with the research results of modern mechanism of dampness pathogen. This article believed that the TCM pathogenesis of colorectal polyps caused by damp pathogen is the accumulation of spleen deficiency and dampness caused by improper diet, poor emotion and other factors, and the interweaving of various diseases and pathogens to form tangible foreign bodies. According to the pathogenic characteristics of damp pathogen and the pathogenic factors of colorectal polyps, the influence of damp pathogen on the pathogenesis of colorectal polyps was discussed, in order to provide an effective TCM theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal polyps in clinic.

By systematically examining Longdan Xiegan Decoction in medical books of the past dynasties, it was found that the Longdan Xiegan Decoction recorded in Lan Shi Mi Cang mainly targeted men's genital odor at first. After Xue Ji's addition and subtraction, the scope of the prescription was gradually generalized and expanded, and confusion its name, composition and source of the prescription appeared, which was particularly prominent in Jingyue Quanshu and Yifang Jijie. Doctors used to interpret this prescription from the perspective of viscera. In order to better understand the main treatment rules of Longdan Xiegan Decoction, it is necessary to change the perspective and reinterpreted it from the perspective of meridians. Attributing the symptoms of the perineum to Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin, hypochondriac pain, deafness and other symptoms to the Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-Shaoyang, and adding or subtracting herbs according to the specific conditions, is not only conducive to a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the prescription to achieve accurate clinical syndrome differentiation and medication, but also prompts modern researchers to rethink the important role of meridian theory in the formation and development of the theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine.

The "qi collaterals-blood collaterals" theory is an applied theory developed based on the collateral disease theory. Understanding the pathogenesis of AR in children from the perspective of damage to collaterals, the damage and consumption to qi collaterals of the lung, spleen, and kidney is the basis for the occurrence and development of AR in children, the imbalance of qi and blood is the core pathogenesis, and wind, cold, phlegm, and blood stasis are the important pathological factors. Moreover, long-term illness can deeply affect the blood, further progressing to damage blood collaterals. Since the pathogenesis of AR is a combination of deficiency and excess, this article aims to provide a new theoretical basis and practical guidance for TCM treatment of AR in children based on the treatment principles of "treating excess with unblocking collaterals and treating deficiency with tonifying collaterals".

The Qihai is the primary Qi of the entire body. When the Qihai is in a state of smoothness, the Qi of lung is able to achieve normalization. Conversely, when the Qihai is in a state of disharmony, the Qi is also disrupted, which can result in the onset of lung diseases. The most effective treatment approach is to employ the method of declaring and descending the Qi movement of Qihai. This method is designed to address the underlying causes of lung diseases.
