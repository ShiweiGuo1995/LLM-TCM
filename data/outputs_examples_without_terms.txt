最近有朋友问我关于汗类病的问题，其实这在中医里属于营卫不和证的一种表现，常伴有腻苔和内寒的症状。治疗时可以试试推揉法，配合舒张进针法，同时注意饮食，少吃酸味食物，以免加重肾不纳气证的情况。日常生活中也要注意保暖，避免病情加重。||Recently, a friend asked me about the problem of excessive sweating; in fact, this belongs to the syndrome of disharmony between Ying and Wei in Traditional Chinese Medicine, often accompanied by greasy coating and internal cold symptoms. When treating, you can try the pushing and kneading technique, combined with the method of needle insertion while relaxing the muscles. At the same time, pay attention to diet, eat less sour food to avoid aggravating the condition of kidney failing to retain Qi. In daily life, also pay attention to keeping warm to avoid aggravating the condition.

中医认为梦魇多与心肺阴虚证有关，常表现为少神、五运六气失衡时症状加重。观察舌象，若见腐苔，则更需注意调理脾胃，因脾在志为思，过思则伤脾，导致气臌等症。临床上，针对此类病症，可用验方进行调治，以达到阴阳平衡的状态。||In TCM, nightmare is often associated with the syndrome of heart and lung yin deficiency, commonly manifested as lack of spirit and aggravation of symptoms when the five elements and six qi are out of balance. Observing the tongue, if one sees greasy coating, it is necessary to pay more attention to regulating the spleen and stomach, as the spleen corresponds to thought; excessive thinking injures the spleen, leading to symptoms such as qi stagnation. In clinical practice, for such conditions, effective prescriptions can be used for regulation to achieve a state of yin-yang balance.

在中医治疗中，我们讲究分经论治，针对不同的病症采用不同的治疗方法。比如牛皮癣，这是一种常见的皮肤病，而侠瘿瘤则是一种颈部肿瘤。在治疗过程中，我们还需注意胞宫热证，避免病情加重。行针是中医常用的治疗方法之一，通过刺激穴位来调整身体机能。对于脾虚生风证和五志化火的情况，我们也需要采取相应的调理措施。当然，在日常生活中，我们也要注意饮食习惯，避免食用过于辛辣的食物，以免引发石蛾等不适症状。||In TCM treatment, we emphasize differential diagnosis and treatment based on meridians; we adopt different therapeutic methods for different diseases. For example, psoriasis is a common skin disease, while xia ying liu is a neck tumor. During the treatment process, we also need to pay attention to the heat syndrome of the uterus to avoid aggravating the condition. Acupuncture is one of the commonly used treatments in TCM, which adjusts bodily functions by stimulating acupoints. For spleen deficiency wind stirring syndrome and five emotions transforming into fire syndrome, we also need to take corresponding调理measures. Of course, in daily life, we should also pay attention to dietary habits and avoid eating overly spicy food to prevent the occurrence of symptoms such as stone silkworm.

在中医理论中，梦魇与伤食常被认为是脾胃功能失调所致。临床观察到患者出现大脉、舌麻痹等症状时，可能需要考虑补益肾气。此外，女性患者若伴有暴泻及固冲止带问题，需警惕野屎风的影响，此病多因气血两虚，湿热内蕴所致，治疗时应注重调理。||In Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, nightmares and sleep paralysis are often attributed to dysfunction of the spleen and stomach. When clinical observations show symptoms such as a large pulse or numbness of the tongue in patients, it may be necessary to consider tonifying kidney qi. Additionally, female patients with symptoms of sudden diarrhea and issues with controlling menstrual flow should be cautious of the influence of Yeshushufeng; this condition is usually caused by both qi and blood deficiency and internal damp-heat, and treatment should focus on regulation.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友出现了月经过少的情况，这可能是由于体内寒湿过重导致的。中医认为心其华在面，如果面色苍白，可能是因为气血不足。而我最近遇到的一个案例是关于冬温病的，患者起初只是觉得身体发热，却没想到是热证，后来发展成了肠痨，真是令人担忧。治疗时发现，他还有痰蕴脾证的症状，需要调理脾胃，化痰祛湿。另外，还有一位患者因为长期熬夜，导致虚实真假难辨，肺主治节失调，出现了咳嗽不止的现象。这些情况都提醒我们，日常生活中要注意调养身体，保持良好的生活习惯。||Recently, many friends have experienced reduced menstrual flow as the weather turned cooler, which may be due to excessive internal cold dampness. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the luster of heart is reflected on the face; if one's complexion is pale, it might be due to insufficient qi and blood. The case I encountered recently was about winter heat disease; the patient initially felt only body heat but did not realize it was a heat syndrome. It later developed into intestinal tuberculosis, causing great concern. During treatment, it was found that he also had symptoms of phlegm accumulating in the spleen, requiring regulation of the spleen and stomach and removing phlegm to dispel dampness. Additionally, another patient experienced persistent coughing due to lung function disorder caused by long-term熬夜, leading to difficulty distinguishing between deficiency and excess conditions. All these situations remind us that we should pay attention to nurturing our bodies and maintaining good living habits in daily life.

在治疗积聚类病时，我们常采用八不传的原则，以确保患者在接受汗法或平旦服等治疗方法时，能够有效清除体内的气分热证。对于一些较为严重的病症如乳发，我们则需要结合清气凉血的方法，并辅以豁痰开窍来达到更好的疗效。这一系列的治疗方法不仅体现了中医辨证施治的精髓，也展示了中医在处理复杂疾病时的独特优势。||In treating diseases of the accumulation type, we often adopt the principle of "Eight Non-Transmissions" to ensure that patients can effectively eliminate qi-related fever symptoms when receiving treatments such as sweating or dawn medication. For more severe conditions like mammary abscess, we need to combine methods of clearing qi and cooling blood, and support it with resolving phlegm and opening the orifices to achieve better therapeutic effects. This series of treatment methods not only embodies the essence of syndrome differentiation and treatment in traditional Chinese medicine but also demonstrates its unique advantages in handling complex diseases.

最近有位朋友向我诉说，他总是感觉身体疲惫不堪，尤其到了下午更是觉得无力，晚上还经常失眠，有时甚至会出现耳闭的症状，严重影响了日常生活。我推测这可能是脾肾气虚不固证的表现。建议他平时可以多吃一些健脾补肾的食物，并尝试用解郁安神的方法来改善睡眠。同时，由于他的工作需要长时间对着电脑，可能会导致肺部不适，出现类似肺积的情况，所以也需要注意呼吸顺畅，可以适当做一些宣肺化痰的练习。如果症状持续不见好转，还是建议及时就医，毕竟健康才是最重要的。||Recently, a friend confided in me that he always feels extremely fatigued, especially in the afternoon, and experiences weakness, frequent insomnia at night, and sometimes even tinnitus, severely affecting his daily life. I speculate this might be a manifestation of spleen-kidney qi deficiency. I suggest he should eat more foods that tonify the spleen and kidneys in his daily life and try methods to relieve depression and calm the mind to improve sleep. At the same time, due to his work requiring him to face a computer for long periods, it may lead to lung discomfort, resulting in symptoms similar to pulmonary accumulation, so he also needs to pay attention to smooth breathing and do appropriate exercises to promote lung ventilation and resolve phlegm. If the symptoms persist without improvement, it is still recommended to seek medical attention promptly, as health is the most important thing after all.

在治疗小儿积滞时，我们常采用活血通络止痛的方法，以促进脾胃功能恢复。对于老年患者出现的老舌症状，结合其肺肾阳虚证的表现，需注重补益肺肾，固护先天之本，同时应用提脓祛腐法以改善局部症状。在慢性咳嗽的治疗中，若见肾不纳气证，应着重调理肺肾，增强气能摄血的功能，从而达到标本兼治的目的。滞颐的发生与脾胃运化失常有关，治疗上亦需重视调理脾胃，促进气血调和。||In the treatment of pediatric food accumulation, we often adopt the method of promoting blood circulation to unblock meridians and relieve pain to facilitate the recovery of spleen and stomach functions. For elderly patients with symptoms of old tongue combined with manifestations of lung and kidney yang deficiency, it is necessary to focus on tonifying lung and kidney, consolidating the innate foundation, while applying the method of lifting pus and removing necrotic tissue to improve local symptoms. In the treatment of chronic cough, if there is evidence of kidney failing to receive qi, it is important to regulate the lung and kidney, enhancing the function of qi in retaining blood, thereby achieving the goal of treating both root cause and symptoms. The occurrence of stagnation of saliva is related to the dysfunction of spleen and stomach transportation; therefore, during treatment, it is also necessary to emphasize the regulation of spleen and stomach, promoting the harmony of qi and blood.

最近感受了风寒，出现了气虚外感证，体质较弱时容易出现这种情况。为了调理身体，我选择了清理三焦热来清除体内的湿热。同时，饮食上也需要注意，避免肝气犯胃证的发生，保持情绪舒畅，饮食清淡，肌肤甲错的情况也有所改善。在治疗过程中，我使用了一些祛瘀止血的草药，用蜜丸的形式服用，既方便又有效。对于一些实热便秘的情况，适量使用攻下药也是必要的。在日常生活中，我还注重阴阳平衡，比如在滋阴的同时不忘阴中求阳，这样才能让身体更加健康。||Recently, I caught a chill and developed symptoms of qi deficiency and exterior pathogenic factors; this tends to happen when my constitution is weak. To adjust my body, I chose to clear the heat from the three burners to eliminate damp-heat inside. At the same time, I paid attention to my diet to avoid the occurrence of liver qi invading the stomach syndrome, maintaining emotional well-being and a light diet, which also improved the condition of rough skin. During treatment, I used some herbs for removing blood stasis and stopping bleeding, taken in honey pills, which were both convenient and effective. For cases of actual heat constipation, it's necessary to use purgative drugs appropriately. In daily life, I also focus on balancing yin and yang, such as nourishing yin while not forgetting to seek yang within yin, to make the body healthier.

小儿囊虫病在中医治疗上多从调理脾胃入手，面黄是其常见症状之一，提示体内可能存在湿热或虚热。针对虚则补之的原则，我们采用清虚热剂以调和阴阳平衡，同时结合舌针疗法刺激特定穴位，达到祛瘀生新的效果，从而改善患儿体质。此外，喜伤心亦需注意，保持情绪舒畅对疾病恢复同样重要。润下法则有助于促进体内湿气排出，进一步巩固疗效。||In the treatment of pediatric cysticercosis in traditional Chinese medicine, the focus is often on regulating the spleen and stomach. Yellowish complexion is one of the common symptoms, indicating the possible presence of damp-heat or vacuous heat inside the body. Following the principle of replenishing what is deficient, we use agents to clear vacuous heat to harmonize yin and yang balance, while combining it with tongue needle therapy to stimulate specific acupoints, achieving the effect of removing blood stasis and promoting new growth, thereby improving the child's constitution. Additionally, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that excessive joy can harm the heart, and maintaining emotional well-being is equally important for disease recovery. The润下法则 (softening and purgative method) helps promote the elimination of dampness inside the body, further consolidating the therapeutic effects.

在探讨中医治疗原则时，我们常提到“通经止痒”与“涩精止遗”，这些方法在临床实践中对于改善精气不足证有着显著效果。根据六经证类的理论，我们可以更准确地辨识病症，从而采用合适的降气剂来治疗气虚血瘀所导致的肺系病，使患者恢复健康。通过深入理解五脏之间的相互作用，我们能够更好地运用上述疗法，达到标本兼治的目的。||When discussing the principles of TCM treatment, we often mention "unblocking meridians to stop itching" and "constricting essence to stop emission," these methods have significant effects in improving symptoms of qi deficiency in clinical practice. According to the theory of the six channels, we can more accurately identify the disease, and thus adopt appropriate qi-reducing agents to treat lung diseases caused by qi deficiency and blood stasis, helping patients recover health. By deeply understanding the interactions between the five organs, we can better apply the aforementioned therapies to achieve the goal of treating both the symptoms and root causes.

For example, recently I met a friend who, due to high work pressure, showed symptoms of internal injury fever. I suggested he try to regulate his condition through Tai Chi push hands while paying attention to his diet and eating more foods that nourish yin and moisten dryness. Additionally, he mentioned often feeling chest oppression and heart pain, and after diagnosis, it was found to be caused by lung yin deficiency, which requires regulation through dietary therapy and appropriate exercise. I also told him that if conditions permit, he could go to the seaside or mountains for recuperation for a period of time because the environment there helps in regulating four seas and middle burner syndromes. Of course, for kidney meridian cold syndromes, we can also improve them through dietary therapy, such as eating more warming and tonifying foods.

在日常生活中，我们常常会遇到一些看似普通的症状，比如痫病发作时的突然倒地，或是孕妇出现的子悬不适。这些情况往往让人措手不及，但通过中医的辨证求因，我们可以更好地理解这些现象背后的原因。比如酒后出现的酒厥，就是因为饮酒过量导致气血运行不畅。治疗时，我们可以通过理气健脾的方法来调理身体，同时也要注意清暑化湿，尤其是在炎热的夏季。对于一些慢性疾病，如水肿问题，中医认为水之上源在于肾，因此需要针对肾脏功能进行调理。在这一过程中，合理使用中药材是非常重要的，它们能够帮助我们恢复健康，提高生活质量。||In daily life, we often encounter some seemingly ordinary symptoms, such as sudden falls during epileptic seizures or the discomfort of breech presentation in pregnant women. These situations often catch people off guard, but through the TCM theory of syndrome differentiation and seeking causes, we can better understand the reasons behind these phenomena. For example, the occurrence of alcohol syncope after drinking is due to excessive alcohol consumption leading to poor circulation of qi and blood. In treatment, we can regulate the body by regulating qi and strengthening the spleen, while also paying attention to clearing summer heat and transforming dampness, especially during hot summers.

Both are caused by external invasion of wind-heat and internal generation of damp-heat, leading to unregulated lung qi and internal formation of phlegm turbidity, which then manifests as symptoms such as coughing and chest tightness. For the method of moistening and transforming dry phlegm, it is particularly important in treating such conditions. As for the syndrome of stone淋 (stone lithiasis), it is usually due to downward infiltration of damp-heat, accumulation forming stones, and obstruction of the urinary tract, manifesting as dysuria and hematuria. Additionally, the syndrome of summer-heat困 spleen is also common in summer, due to summer-dampness obstructing the spleen and stomach, with impaired transportation and transformation, presenting symptoms such as poor appetite and abdominal distension. Regarding skin diseases like ringworm, although not directly related to the above internal diseases, according to TCM theory, internal and external factors interrelate, and regulating the whole body is fundamental. Through syndrome differentiation and treatment, harmonizing yin and yang, one can achieve the purpose of treating the root cause of the disease.

For patients with gastric dryness and fluid deficiency, in addition to using herbal medicines to nourish yin and moisten dryness, attention should also be paid to dietary conditioning to avoid further drying of the stomach. The syndrome of warm pathogenic factors attacking the lung exterior is common in spring; at this time, using appropriate heat-clearing and detoxifying drugs can effectively alleviate symptoms. If there is a sensation of burning in the anus, it may be due to damp-heat descending, requiring regulation of organ functions to expel damp-heat from the body. Additionally, heart-kidney yang deficiency is manifested by symptoms such as fear of cold and cold limbs, and treatment should focus on warming and supplementing the heart and kidney; while the onset of reverse rushing Qi indicates liver qi stagnation, requiring the smoothing of liver qi to restore the body's balance.

Another patient suffered from qi swelling due to improper diet, leading to abdominal distension. Additionally, I discovered that children are prone to develop running sore in the mouth, which requires us to pay special attention to oral hygiene. In treatment, I use some hemostatic agents to alleviate symptoms while also employing massage techniques to regulate the body. Of course, if it's under yangming meridian syndrome, the treatment approach would be different. I hope my sharing can help everyone better understand and prevent these diseases.

最近有位朋友来找我咨询，说是身上长了上石疽，而且感觉身体不适，既有表里的症状，又伴有手少阳三焦经的不适感。在给他诊断时，我发现他的面色有些暗沉，这可能是望色的结果，结合他胃部的不适，初步判断为胃寒气逆证。为了更好地了解他的状况，我还进行了脉色合参，发现他的脉象也不太正常。治疗方面，我想采用清暑宣肺的方法来缓解他的症状，同时调理他的体质，希望他能早日康复。在日常生活中，我们要注意饮食，避免寒凉食物，燥和中是关键。||Recently, a friend came to consult me, saying that he had developed a carbuncle on his body and felt unwell, with symptoms both inside and outside the body, accompanied by discomfort in the hand shaoyang triple burner meridian. During diagnosis, I found his complexion somewhat dull, which might be the result of observing his color; combined with his stomach discomfort, I initially judged it as a cold stomach qi rebellion syndrome. To better understand his condition, I also conducted a comprehensive examination of pulse and color, finding his pulse not quite normal either. In terms of treatment, I want to use the method of clearing summer heat and promoting lung function to alleviate his symptoms while regulating his constitution, hoping for his early recovery. In daily life, we should pay attention to our diet, avoiding cold and cool foods, and drying and harmonizing the middle is key.

最近在学习中医知识时，发现很多有趣的理论。比如“关脉”和“五输穴”，这些都在帮助我们更好地理解身体的奥秘。还有，“缩阴”和“圆裆”的练习，据说能增强体质，提升生活质量。但要注意，如果出现“饮停胸胁证”或“痰热内闭证”，则需要及时调理，避免发展成更严重的“精癃”。通过日常的小习惯，如保持正确的坐姿，可以有效预防这些问题。希望大家都能关注自己的身体健康，享受中医带来的益处。||Recently, while studying Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), I discovered many interesting theories. For example, "Guan Mai" and "Five Shu Points," all of which help us better understand the mysteries of the body. Additionally, practices such as "Vaginal Contraction" and "Circular Crotch" are said to enhance physical health and improve quality of life. However, it's important to note that if conditions like "Water Stagnation in the Thoracic and Costal Regions" or "Phlegm-Heat Obstructing the Lungs" occur, timely adjustment is necessary to prevent them from developing into more serious conditions like "Essence Deficiency." Through daily small habits, such as maintaining proper posture, these issues can be effectively prevented. I hope everyone will pay attention to their own health and enjoy the benefits brought by TCM.

在日常生活中，我们常常会遇到一些看似平常却暗藏健康隐患的症状。比如有些朋友可能会出现口辛的情况，这可能是脾胃功能失调的表现。而当我们讨论如何调理时，不仅需要辨病，更要内外相合，通过调整生活方式和饮食习惯来达到神气鼓荡的效果。对于孕妇来说，妊娠脉的变化尤为重要，它能帮助我们了解母体与胎儿的健康状况。在治疗过程中，得气是针灸治疗的关键，也是患者感受疗效的重要标志。当然，在选择药材时，修制也是一门学问，好的药材才能更好地发挥药效。总之，中医不仅仅是治病，更是调养身心，让我们一起学习更多中医知识，共同守护健康。||In daily life, we often encounter some seemingly ordinary symptoms that conceal health risks. For example, some friends might experience a bitter taste in their mouth, which could be a sign of dysfunction in the spleen and stomach. When discussing how to regulate these issues, it's not only necessary to diagnose the condition but also to combine internal and external adjustments by modifying lifestyle and dietary habits to achieve the effect of invigorating the spirit. For pregnant women, changes in the pulse during pregnancy are particularly important as they can help us understand the health status of both the mother and the fetus. During the treatment process, obtaining qi is crucial in acupuncture therapy and is also an important indicator for patients to feel the effectiveness of the treatment. Of course, when selecting herbs, preparation is also a discipline; good quality herbs can better exert their effects. In short, traditional Chinese medicine is not only about curing diseases but also about nurturing the body and mind. Let's learn more about traditional Chinese medicine together and protect our health collectively.

在本次研究中，我们探讨了心脾两虚证与偏痹之间的关系，发现心脾两虚证患者常伴有小便黄赤、多梦等症状，舌象表现为舌质淡、苔薄白，脉象则多见涩脉。此外，针对胃寒饮停证患者，我们亦观察到类似的小便黄赤现象，提示该症状可能与多种证候相关。治疗上，对于心脾两虚证合并偏痹者，采用清心泻肺法以调和气血，缓解偏痹症状；而对于胃寒饮停证，则需温阳化饮，佐以活血通络之品，避免病情进一步发展为胎疮等严重后果。||In this study, we explored the relationship between heart-spleen deficiency and hemiplegia, finding that patients with heart-spleen deficiency often exhibit symptoms such as yellowish-red urine and frequent dreaming, with tongue appearances characterized by pale tongues with thin white coating and pulse manifestations showing涩脉. Additionally, for patients with stomach-cold fluid retention syndrome, we also observed similar phenomena of yellowish-red urine, suggesting that this symptom may be related to multiple syndromes. In treatment, for those with heart-spleen deficiency combined with hemiplegia, we use the method of clearing the heart and draining the lung to regulate qi and blood, alleviating hemiplegia symptoms; for stomach-cold fluid retention syndrome, warming yang and transforming fluid is needed, supplemented with blood-activating and meridian-connecting remedies to avoid further deterioration of the condition into serious consequences such as vitiligo.

最近有朋友问我关于手脚冰凉的问题，说是一到冬天手足厥冷就特别严重，晚上睡觉时还会出现血脉不畅的情况，这其实是气血运行不畅导致的，中医认为这与六郁有关，尤其是气郁会导致血随气逆。在日常生活中，我们可以通过推拿复合手法类来缓解症状，比如轻轻按摩可以促进血液循环，同时要注意关门不利，避免寒气入侵。如果情况较为严重，可能需要通过针灸等方法调整体内气血，有时医生会用到代脉来判断病情。另外，平时也可以适当采用报刺法以达到疏通经络的目的。总之，保持良好的生活习惯和合理的饮食结构对于改善这类问题非常关键。||Recently, a friend asked me about the problem of cold hands and feet, saying that it becomes particularly severe in winter when there is a significant coldness in the extremities, and during sleep, there can be issues with blood circulation. This is actually caused by poor blood circulation, and traditional Chinese medicine believes this is related to the six depressions, especially qi depression which can lead to blood stagnation. In daily life, we can alleviate symptoms through composite massage techniques; for example, light massage can promote blood circulation, while also paying attention to keeping doors closed to avoid invasion of cold air. If the situation is more serious, methods such as acupuncture may be needed to adjust the body's qi and blood, and sometimes doctors use Dai pulse to diagnose the condition. Additionally, one can appropriately adopt the Baoci method to achieve the purpose of unblocking meridians. In short, maintaining good living habits and a reasonable diet structure is very crucial for improving such problems.

最近有朋友问我关于身体的一些疑惑，比如为何会出现便秘的情况，我告诉他这可能是因为体内湿气过重导致的，需要使用一些清热药来帮助润肠泄热。同时，我们还要关注肝血是否充足，因为肝血不足也会引起一系列不适。在日常生活中，我们要注重脏腑相合，比如六阳脉和十五络脉的调理，保持气血畅通。另外，如果舌苔呈现为腐苔，可能是体内湿寒过重，这时可以采用温阳化饮的方法来调理。总之，养生保健需从细节入手，希望大家都能健康生活。||Recently, a friend asked me about some doubts regarding their body, such as why constipation occurs. I told them it might be due to excessive dampness inside the body, which requires the use of heat-clearing medicine to help moisten the intestines and clear heat. At the same time, we should also pay attention to whether the liver blood is sufficient, as insufficient liver blood can also cause a series of discomforts. In daily life, we should focus on the coordination of organs, such as regulating the Six Yang Meridians and Fifteen Collaterals to maintain smooth flow of qi and blood. Additionally, if the tongue coating appears as putrid coating, it may indicate excessive internal cold-dampness. In this case, we can use the method of warming yang and transforming fluid retention for regulation. In short, health preservation needs to start from the details. I hope everyone can live healthily.

在探讨燥易伤肺与温补肺阳的治疗策略时，我们注意到患者常表现为闷痛及淡紫舌，此乃肺功能失调之征象。结合临床观察，运用穴位注射疗法，可以有效改善上述症状。此外，对于伴有太阳蓄血证的患者，需综合考虑其气血运行状态，采用和中安神之法以调和机体。值得注意的是，在治疗过程中，对疳积患者的调理亦不可忽视，因其与整体健康状况密切相关。通过上述方法，我们期待达到标本兼治的效果，进一步提高临床疗效。||When discussing the treatment strategies for dryness injuring the lungs and warming to supplement lung yang, we noticed that patients often exhibit symptoms such as闷痛及淡紫舌, which are signs of lung dysfunction. Combining clinical observations, the use of acupoint injection therapy can effectively improve the aforementioned symptoms. Additionally, for patients with concurrent symptoms of sunyangxue syndrome, it is necessary to comprehensively consider their qi and blood circulation status and adopt a method of harmonizing the body to calm the spirit. It is noteworthy that during the treatment process, the regulation of rickets patients should not be overlooked, as it is closely related to overall health. Through the above methods, we aim to achieve both symptomatic and radical treatment effects, further enhancing clinical efficacy.

在探讨阴虚津亏证与瘀热入络证的治疗策略时，我们发现小方的应用具有显著效果。特别是在阴虚津亏证的治疗中，通过固涩摄乳与温化寒痰的结合，能够有效改善患者症状。此外，对于瘀热入络证，采用温化寒痰剂进行治疗，亦能取得良好疗效。同时，在临床实践中，导引作为一种辅助治疗方法，对促进囊虫病患者的康复也起到重要作用。综上所述，合理运用上述方法和药物，能够更好地服务于患者的健康需求。||In exploring the treatment strategies for yin deficiency and fluid deficiency syndrome and blood stasis heat entering the network vessels syndrome, we found that the application of small formulas has significant effects. Especially in treating yin deficiency and fluid deficiency syndrome, by combining astringent milk retention and warming to transform cold phlegm, we can effectively improve patients' symptoms. Additionally, for blood stasis heat entering the network vessels syndrome, using warming to transform cold phlegm agents also achieves good therapeutic outcomes. Meanwhile, in clinical practice, guiding as an auxiliary treatment method plays a crucial role in promoting the recovery of patients with cysticercosis. In summary, reasonably applying the aforementioned methods and medications can better serve the health needs of patients.

最近春意盎然，正是春夏养阳的好时节。大家在日常生活中不妨多晒晒太阳，增强体质。我最近在门诊时遇到一位患者，他面色苍白，畏寒怕冷，这显然是实寒证的表现。经过一番辨证施治，我决定采用扶正补气的方法，并辅以悬灸来温通经络。此外，我还建议他多吃一些温热性质的食物，如姜和葱，避免生冷食物。另一位患者则出现了热入气分证的症状，表现为发热口渴，我给他开了些清热解毒的方子，并配合豁痰燥的治疗方法。中医讲究因人而异，同一种病症在不同人体内表现可能大不相同，因此治疗也要灵活变通。记得保持良好的生活习惯，适当运动，才能更好地调养身体，预防疾病。||Recently, with the arrival of spring and the approach of summer, it is a good time to nourish yang energy. Everyone can take advantage of this period by getting more sun exposure to boost physical health. Recently, during my clinic sessions, I encountered a patient who had a pale complexion and felt cold easily, which clearly indicated symptoms of actual cold syndrome. After careful diagnosis and treatment, I decided to use the method of supporting the body's defenses and invigorating qi, supplemented with moxibustion to warm and unblock meridians. Additionally, I recommended that he eat more warm-natured foods such as ginger and green onions, and avoid cold and raw foods. Another patient exhibited symptoms of heat entering the qi level, characterized by fever and thirst, for whom I prescribed formulas for clearing heat and detoxifying, along with treatments to resolve phlegm and dry dampness. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes individual differences; the same disease may manifest quite differently in different people, so treatment must be flexible and adaptable. Remember to maintain good living habits and engage in appropriate exercise to better regulate your body and prevent diseases.

本研究旨在探讨温燥伤肺证患者出现渴不欲饮症状时的治疗策略。通过临床观察发现，此类患者常伴有干燥症表现，提示津液不足。基于此，采用滋阴安神之法，辅以平性药调节，旨在调和营血，恢复阴阳平衡。进一步分析表明，对于阴阳两虚证患者，需结合敛肺止咳药物，以达到标本兼治的效果。综上所述，针对温燥伤肺证患者的治疗，应注重滋阴润燥与调和营血并举，同时兼顾敛肺止咳，方能取得良好疗效。||This study aims to explore the treatment strategies for patients with the syndrome of dryness and heat injuring the lung who exhibit symptoms of thirst without desire to drink. Clinical observations have found that such patients often present with signs of xeroderma, indicating insufficient body fluids. Based on this, the method of nourishing yin and calming the spirit is adopted, supplemented by the use of neutral drugs to regulate, aiming to harmonize Ying and Xue, and restore the balance of Yin and Yang. Further analysis indicates that for patients with deficiency of both Yin and Yang, astringent drugs for consolidating the lung and stopping cough should be combined to achieve the effect of treating both root cause and symptoms. In summary, in the treatment of patients with the syndrome of dryness and heat injuring the lung, emphasis should be placed on nourishing yin and moistening dryness as well as harmonizing Ying and Xue, while also taking into account the consolidation of the lung and stopping cough, in order to achieve good therapeutic effects.

小儿蛔虫病常因脾胃虚弱引起，治疗时需注重培土生金原则，以调理脾胃功能。在临床观察中，若患者出现热入血分证或痰瘀阻膈证，应采用傍针刺等方法促进气血流通。牙齿作为齿为骨之余，其健康状况亦能反映体内气血是否调和。对于损伤内证病患者，需细致辨证施治，避免痰闭心窍证的发生。通过综合治疗，方能达到标本兼治的效果。||Pediatric ascariasis is often caused by spleen and stomach weakness, and during treatment, the principle of cultivating earth to generate metal should be emphasized to regulate the functions of the spleen and stomach. In clinical observations, if patients exhibit symptoms of heat entering the blood stage or phlegm-blood stasis blocking the diaphragm, methods such as旁针刺 should be used to promote the circulation of qi and blood. Teeth, being the remnants of bones, can also reflect whether the body's qi and blood are harmonized. For patients with internal injury syndromes, detailed syndrome differentiation and treatment should be conducted to avoid the occurrence of phlegm blocking the heart orifice syndrome. Through comprehensive treatment, both the symptoms and root causes can be addressed.

在日常生活中，我们经常会遇到一些小病小痛，比如轻微的水火烫伤，这时候我们可以使用一些简单的家庭疗法，如用解表清热的方法来缓解症状。另外，如果感觉身体不适，尤其是出现肺实热证的症状时，可以考虑通过饮食调理，多吃一些滋阴润燥剂的食物，如梨和百合。同时，对于那些经常感到胸闷腹胀的人来说，行气消痞是非常重要的，可以通过适当的运动和按摩来进行。中医认为，每个人的体质不同，所以治疗方案也会有所不同，比如针对风热犯表证的人群，可能需要更加注重调节体内的阴阳平衡，而岁会等节气的变化也会影响到我们的健康状态，因此顺应自然规律进行调养是十分必要的。||In daily life, we often encounter minor illnesses and discomforts, such as slight burns from water or fire. At these times, we can use simple home remedies, such as using methods to relieve exterior and clear heat to alleviate symptoms. Additionally, if one feels unwell, especially when showing symptoms of lung excess heat syndrome, dietary adjustments can be considered, eating more foods that nourish yin and moisten dryness, such as pears and lilies. At the same time, for those who frequently feel chest tightness and abdominal distension, promoting qi flow and eliminating痞is very important, which can be achieved through appropriate exercise and massage. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, each person's constitution is different, so treatment plans will also vary. For example, for people with wind-heat attacking the exterior syndrome, it may be necessary to pay more attention to regulating the balance of yin and yang within the body. Moreover, changes in seasonal nodes like Start of Autumn will also affect our health status, so it is essential to follow the natural laws for conditioning.

中医认为“气为血之帅”，在治疗脾胃疾病时，“理气消痞”尤为重要。若患者出现“脾阴不足”，常伴随“泛酸”症状，此时需采用“大泻刺”法调理。“清热化毒”也是治疗过程中不可或缺的手段，尤其对于“含腮疮”的患者来说更为重要。同时，若体质表现为“卫强营弱”，则更需注重调和阴阳，以达到治病的目的。||In TCM, "Qi is the commander of blood," and when treating spleen and stomach diseases, "regulating Qi to eliminate痞" is particularly important. If a patient exhibits "insufficient spleen Yin," it is often accompanied by "acid regurgitation" symptoms; in this case, the "major purgation needling" method should be used for adjustment. "Clearing heat and transforming toxicity" is also an indispensable approach in the treatment process, especially crucial for patients with "parotitis." At the same time, if the constitution is characterized as "strong defensive qi and weak nutritive qi," then greater emphasis should be placed on harmonizing yin and yang to achieve the goal of treating the disease.

最近天气湿热，不少朋友出现了疖病的症状，建议用煎剂调理，如金银花、连翘等药材可以帮助清热存津。若出现口舌生疮或痰多的情况，可能是体内营分热盛证的表现，可以适当饮用一些清凉去火的茶饮。对于那些脚气问题，也请注意饮食清淡，避免寒滞胃肠证的发生。同时，孩子在百晬内嗽也需要特别关注，适时调整饮食结构，增强体质。日常生活中，我们要注意身体的变化，及时采取措施，保持健康。||Recently, due to the humid and hot weather, many friends have shown symptoms of boils; it is recommended to use decoctions for adjustment, such as honeysuckle and forsythia, which can help clear heat and retain body fluids. If there are symptoms like mouth ulcers or excessive phlegm, it might be a sign of internal nutrient level heat excess syndrome, and you can appropriately drink some tea to clear heat and reduce fire. For those with foot problems, pay attention to a light diet to avoid the occurrence of cold stagnation in the gastrointestinal tract syndrome. At the same time, special attention should be paid to children under 100 days who are coughing, and adjust their diet structure in time to strengthen their physique. In daily life, we need to pay attention to changes in our bodies and take timely measures to maintain health.

在探讨肝衰病时，我们常常会遇到肝风内动证的情况，这与肾气亏虚证密切相关。通过指法诊断可以发现，血海不足和心包络受阻是常见现象。此外，壮火旺盛亦能导致蛊胀，这些因素共同作用于人体，使得疾病更加复杂。因此，在治疗上，既要注重补益肾气，又要平息肝风，同时调节心包络与血海的通畅。||When discussing liver failure, we often encounter the condition of internal stirring of liver wind, which is closely related to kidney qi deficiency. Through pulse diagnosis, it can be found that insufficiency of the blood sea and obstruction of the pericardium are common phenomena. Additionally, exuberant flaming heat can also lead to ascites, and these factors act together on the body, making the disease more complicated. Therefore, in treatment, it is necessary to not only focus on replenishing kidney qi but also to calm the liver wind, while regulating the smooth flow of the pericardium and the blood sea.

在治疗蛇头疔时，我们常采用除湿通络的方法，结合悬起灸以温通经络，缓解因寒滞经络证引起的疼痛。此外，在面对风水引起的病症时，需辨证施治，若患者出现寒战、真心痛等半表半里证的症状，应采取相应措施，以达到调和阴阳、扶正祛邪的目的。||In the treatment of snake head carbuncle, we often adopt the method of eliminating dampness and unblocking the meridians, combined with hanging moxibustion to warm and unblock the meridians, relieving pain caused by cold obstruction of the meridians. Additionally, when dealing with diseases caused by water retention, syndrome differentiation should be applied for treatment. If the patient exhibits symptoms of half-exterior half-interior syndrome such as chills and true heartache, corresponding measures should be taken to achieve the purpose of harmonizing yin and yang and strengthening the healthy while removing the pathogenic factors.

最近有位家长问我关于孩子囟陷的问题，这让我想到了中医里的“提弹法”，在治疗上可以试试看。同时观察到孩子有些肺恶寒的症状，可能与体内膀胱积热证有关，需要及时调理。记得在日常生活中，我们也要关注孩子的饮食，避免食用过于油腻的食物，以免加重膀胱积热的情况。另外，现在正是季节交替的时候，也是小儿血吸虫病高发期，家长们一定要注意预防。说到调理，我们不能忽视胆气的重要性，它与情绪、睡眠等都有密切关系。中医常说“血汗同源”，所以在调理时也需要注意气血的平衡。最后，还要提醒大家注意六气的变化，顺应自然规律，才能保持健康。||Recently, a parent asked me about their child's fontanelle depression, which reminded me of the "lifting and pressing method" in Traditional Chinese Medicine; it might be worth trying in treatment. At the same time, I noticed that the child showed symptoms of lung aversion to cold, which may be related to bladder heat accumulation syndrome in the body, requiring timely adjustment. Remember, in daily life, we should also pay attention to the child's diet, avoiding overly greasy foods to prevent aggravating the bladder heat accumulation. Additionally, it is currently the season transition period, which is also the high incidence period for schistosomiasis in children, so parents must pay attention to prevention. When talking about adjustment, we cannot ignore the importance of gallbladder qi, which has close relations with emotions, sleep, etc. As TCM often says, "blood and sweat share the same origin," so during adjustment, we also need to pay attention to the balance of qi and blood. Finally, everyone should also pay attention to the changes in the six qi, following the laws of nature to maintain health.

通过对一例肾精亏损导致乳漏反复发作患者的研究发现，该病例在治疗初期表现为血虚肠燥证，采用温阳散寒法治疗效果不佳。进一步辨证分析，认为病因与肝胃不调证密切相关，且存在神气不足的表现。结合“虚则补其母”的原则，最终确定以补益肝肾、调理脾胃为治则，并辅以温补肾阳之法，经过一段时间治疗后，患者症状明显改善。此外，本案例亦提示我们在临床中需重视冬瘟病的发生，以防病情复杂化。||A study on a patient with recurrent galactorrhea caused by kidney essence deficiency found that the patient initially presented with blood deficiency and intestinal dryness syndrome during the early stages of treatment, and the warming yang and dispersing cold method was not effective. Further differential analysis suggested that the cause was closely related to disharmony between the liver and stomach, and there were signs of insufficient spirit. Combining the principle of "tonifying the mother when there is deficiency," it was ultimately determined to tonify the liver and kidneys and regulate the spleen and stomach, supplemented by warming and tonifying the kidney yang. After a period of treatment, the patient's symptoms significantly improved. Additionally, this case also reminds us in clinical practice to pay attention to the occurrence of winter febrile diseases to prevent the complication of the condition.

在日常生活中，我们常会遇到一些看似平常却需要细心调理的小毛病。比如有些人会出现呃逆的情况，这可能是由于体内出现了内生五邪，导致气机不畅。对于这种情况，我们可以尝试通过开呼合吸的方法来调整呼吸，促进气血运行。如果伴有便秘，那么泻火通便就显得尤为重要，帮助清理体内热毒。同时，若出现精室瘀阻证，说明可能有血瘀现象，这时候可以考虑使用活血化瘀的方法。当然，如果症状较为复杂，比如既有金实不鸣又有呃逆，这就需要综合运用多种方法，如化痰开窍等，以达到表里出入的效果，最终恢复健康。总之，保持良好的生活习惯和合理的饮食结构，是预防这些小病小痛的关键。||In daily life, we often encounter some seemingly ordinary but requires careful adjustment of minor ailments. For example, some people may experience hiccups, which could be due to the appearance of endogenous five evils inside the body, leading to stagnation of qi. For such cases, we can try to adjust breathing by opening the mouth and inhaling deeply to promote the circulation of qi and blood. If constipation is also present, then clearing heat and promoting bowel movements becomes particularly important, helping to clear internal heat toxins. At the same time, if there is a symptom of blood stasis, it might indicate the presence of blood stasis, in which case methods to invigorate blood circulation and resolve stasis can be considered. Of course, if the symptoms are more complex, such as both metal deficiency causing no sound and hiccups, then a combination of methods like resolving phlegm and opening orifices would be needed to achieve the effect of regulating both internal and external conditions, ultimately restoring health. In short, maintaining good living habits and a reasonable dietary structure is key to preventing these minor ailments.

春季到来，天气转暖，但有时寒气仍未完全退去，我们需要注意预防冻疮的发生。饮食上要清淡，避免食用过于辛辣刺激的食物，以免引发六淫之邪。最近我发现有些人出现了肠道不适的情况，这可能是由于肠风伤络证引起的，建议及时调理。小孩子要注意营养均衡，避免出现乳疳的情况。另外，记得定期驱虫，以防寸白虫病。在日常生活中，我们要学会行气消痞，保持良好的生活习惯，如果出现阳厥症状，要及时就医调理。通过这些方法，我们可以更好地维护身体健康。||With the arrival of spring, the weather warms up, but sometimes the cold has not completely receded; we need to pay attention to prevent chilblains. Diet should be light, avoiding overly spicy and stimulating foods to prevent the invasion of the six exogenous pathogenic factors. Recently, I found that some people have experienced discomfort in their intestines, which may be caused by intestinal wind injuring the network vessels; it is recommended to adjust in time. Children should pay attention to balanced nutrition to avoid the occurrence of malnutrition. Additionally, remember to deworm regularly to prevent寸白虫disease. In daily life, we should learn to regulate qi and eliminate stagnation, maintain good living habits, and seek medical treatment for yang collapse symptoms in time. Through these methods, we can better maintain our health.

在探讨中医的整体观念时，我们不仅要关注局部症状，还要考虑到患者全身的状态。例如，对于风中经络证的治疗，我们除了使用拔伸法缓解局部症状外，还需要注重调理脾胃，以应对可能伴随的脾痟。在某些情况下，如遇到禁口痢这样的病症时，还需结合患者的具体情况，采取相应的治疗方法。同时，皮痹作为常见的皮肤病，其治疗也需遵循整体观念，不可仅限于皮肤表面的处理。对于孕痈这类特殊时期的疾病，更需要细心辨证施治，确保母婴安全。而关于敞裆这一现象，虽然不常见于现代中医文献，但在特定历史背景下，它与某些疾病的关联仍值得研究。||When discussing the holistic concept of TCM, we should not only focus on local symptoms but also consider the patient's overall condition. For example, in treating the syndrome of wind entering the meridians, besides using traction methods to alleviate local symptoms, we also need to pay attention to regulating the spleen and stomach to address possible accompanying spleen deficiency. In some cases, such as encountering dysentery with closed mouth, corresponding treatment methods need to be adopted based on the patient's specific situation. At the same time, as a common skin disease, the treatment of cutaneous bi syndrome also needs to follow the holistic concept and cannot be limited to dealing with the surface of the skin. For diseases like pregnancy carbuncle during special periods, more careful syndrome differentiation and treatment are required to ensure the safety of both mother and child. As for the phenomenon of open crotch, although it is not commonly found in modern TCM literature, under certain historical contexts, its association with certain diseases still deserves research.

本文探讨了产褥劳与产后恶露不绝在临床中的辨证施治，指出两者常伴发伤津及外燥袭表证，治疗上需注重调理十二正经气血，以促进机体恢复。同时，对于下石疽等外科病症，亦应考虑其与正水的关系，综合运用内外兼治之法。通过对典型病例的分析，进一步验证了上述观点，为临床提供参考。||This paper explores the辩证施治of puerperal fatigue and postpartum lochia retention in clinical practice, pointing out that these two conditions often accompany symptoms of body fluid depletion and external dryness affecting the exterior. Treatment should focus on regulating the qi and blood of the twelve regular meridians to promote physical recovery. At the same time, for surgical conditions such as scrofula, the relationship with zhengshui should also be considered, employing a comprehensive approach of internal and external treatments. The analysis of typical cases further validates the aforementioned viewpoints, providing reference for clinical practice.

中医认为，产后女性因气血两虚，易出现血气冲心之症，需及时调理。同时，阳维脉证亦需关注，以防止寒邪入侵。太阴人体质特殊，更易受外邪侵袭，表现为鼻鼽频发。若饮食不当，劳逸失度，则易致中焦热盛证，引发胆胀不适。此外，霍乱时疫亦不可忽视，需防微杜渐，以维护健康。||According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, postpartum women are prone to symptoms of qi and blood deficiency, such as blood rushing to the heart, which requires timely adjustment. At the same time, the yangwei meridian syndrome should also be taken into account to prevent invasion by cold pathogens. Individuals with taiyin constitutional traits are particularly susceptible to external pathogenic factors, manifesting as frequent nasal allergies. Improper diet or imbalance between work and rest can easily lead to excessive heat in the middle jiao, causing discomfort from distension of the gallbladder. Additionally, seasonal epidemics like cholera should not be overlooked and must be prevented to maintain health.

最近有位朋友跟我聊起她的母亲，她母亲最近总是感觉胸痹心痛，有时候还会出现鹭鸶咳的情况，听我介绍了一些调理方法后，她又提到她的孩子身上长了些脓疱疮，让我帮忙看看。我建议她先从脾胃虚热证着手调理，同时注意解毒开肺，五脏开窍也很重要。另外，她还提到她母亲之前有过产后痉病的经历，这让我更加重视五脏开窍和胸痹心痛的问题。希望我的一些建议能帮到她们，也提醒大家平时多关注家人的身体健康，及时调理。||Recently, a friend of mine mentioned her mother who has been experiencing chest tightness and heart pain recently, and sometimes even has the symptom of egrets cough. After I introduced some调理 methods to her, she also mentioned that her child had developed pus blisters, asking me for advice. I suggested she start by regulating spleen and stomach heat syndrome, while also paying attention to detoxifying and opening the lungs; opening the orifices of the five viscera is also very important. Additionally, she mentioned that her mother had previously experienced postpartum tetany, which made me pay even more attention to the issues of opening the orifices of the five viscera and chest tightness and heart pain. I hope my suggestions can be helpful to them, and also remind everyone to pay more attention to their family's health and regulate in time.

最近遇到一位患者，由于饮食不洁导致身体不适，出现了花柳毒淋的症状。在治疗过程中，我采用了刨推法和震颤法相结合的方式，同时指导他要注重滋补肺阴，气能生津。另外，还建议他在日常生活中要注意休息，避免过度劳累，以免引发子痫等严重问题。在调理期间，我还教了他一些简单的屈伸法，帮助他恢复身体健康。通过这些综合措施，患者的病情得到了很好的控制和改善。||Recently, I encountered a patient who experienced discomfort and symptoms of venereal disease due to unclean diet. During the treatment process, I combined the scraping and pushing method with the trembling method, while also guiding him to focus on nourishing lung yin to promote body fluid production. Additionally, I advised him to pay attention to rest in daily life and avoid overwork to prevent serious issues such as eclampsia. During the adjustment period, I taught him some simple flexion and extension exercises to help restore his health. Through these comprehensive measures, the patient's condition was well controlled and improved.

中医认为，卫营同病常表现为多种症状，如黄水疮和大头瘟等，这些病症往往需要通过活血止痛、化毒消肿的方法来治疗。在妇科疾病中，乳癌患者亦可见类似表现，治疗时需辨证施治，采用相应疗法。此外，情绪波动引起的喜证也可能伴随上述症状出现，治疗时需兼顾调理情志。对于喉岩这类咽喉疾病，同样需要运用化毒消肿的原则进行处理。在临床实践中，综合运用以上方法对症下药，才能取得较好的疗效。||In TCM, Wei and Ying co-morbidity often manifests as various symptoms such as yellow water sores and big head plague, etc., which usually require treatment through methods like promoting blood circulation to relieve pain, detoxifying, and reducing swelling. In gynecological diseases, patients with breast cancer may also exhibit similar manifestations; when treating them, syndrome differentiation should be performed, and corresponding therapies should be adopted. Additionally, the symptom of joy caused by emotional fluctuations may also accompany the aforementioned symptoms, so during treatment, emotional regulation should be taken into account. For throat rock and other throat diseases, the principle of detoxifying and reducing swelling should also be applied in treatment. In clinical practice, only by comprehensively applying the above methods can better therapeutic effects be achieved.

在中医理论中，补阳是治疗阳气不足的重要方法之一，适用于多种疾病如骨痨等。对于因外感风寒引发的痧病，采用补阳疗法可以增强机体抵抗力。若患者出现声嘶症状，可能是由于热实结胸证导致，此时需结合补心安神以缓解症状。而针对脑萎患者，除了补阳之外，还需关注其饮食起居，避免外关内格的发生。总之，在临床实践中，合理运用这些治疗方法能够有效改善患者的健康状况。||In Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, replenishing Yang is one of the important methods for treating insufficient Yang energy and is applicable to various diseases such as bone tuberculosis. For Sha disease caused by external wind-cold invasion, adopting Yang-replenishing therapy can enhance the body's resistance. If the patient exhibits symptoms of hoarseness, it may be due to the syndrome of heat accumulation in the chest, at which point it is necessary to combine heart-nourishing and spirit-soothing treatments to alleviate the symptoms. For patients with brain atrophy, in addition to replenishing Yang, attention should also be paid to their diet and daily life to prevent the occurrence of internal and external obstruction. In short, in clinical practice, reasonably applying these treatment methods can effectively improve the patient's health condition.

在探讨精癃与肾间动气的关系时，我们发现二者虽表现各异，但皆与肾脏功能失调有关。太仓，即脾胃，其运化功能对全身气血津液的生成至关重要，而脾主肌肉，对于维持肌肉健康同样重要。菜乌紫病并非现代医学疾病名称，但在某些文献中可能指代一种因气血瘀滞导致皮肤呈现异常颜色的病症。针对胆疸，临床观察发现其常与脾胃湿热有关，治疗上需注重调理脾胃，清利湿热。酒厥，多由饮酒过量，湿热内生，导致气机逆乱所致，治疗时需以醒脾化湿为先。小儿风痧则是一种常见于儿童的外感疾病，治疗时除疏风解表外，还需兼顾调和脾胃。通过上述分析可见，中医理论体系中各脏腑之间存在着密切联系，治疗时需综合考虑，方能取得良好疗效。||When discussing the relationship between jinglong and kidney qi, we found that although they manifest differently, both are related to dysfunction of the kidneys. Taicang, which refers to the spleen and stomach, plays a crucial role in the production of qi, blood, and body fluids throughout the body, while the spleen governs muscles, which is equally important for maintaining muscle health. Caiwuzi disease is not a term used in modern medicine, but it may refer to a condition in some literature where skin color changes abnormally due to stagnation of qi and blood. Regarding daji, clinical observations have found that it is often associated with damp-heat in the spleen and stomach; treatment should focus on regulating the spleen and stomach and clearing damp-heat. Jiujue, often caused by excessive drinking leading to internal damp-heat and disrupting the flow of qi, requires treatment focused on awakening the spleen and resolving dampness. Xiaofengsha is a common external infection in children; treatment should not only involve dispersing wind and resolving exterior symptoms but also consider harmonizing the spleen and stomach. Through the above analysis, it can be seen that there are close relationships among the organs in the TCM theoretical system, and comprehensive consideration is necessary during treatment to achieve good therapeutic effects.

本文旨在探讨疖肿与疫斑热在临床表现及治疗策略上的异同。研究表明，疖肿的发生与脾合胃功能失调密切相关，而疫斑热则常表现为太阳腑证或太阴病证。在治疗过程中，需注重滋养肝阴，以改善体内环境，同时对于痰浊中阻证患者，应采取相应措施调理脏腑机能，促进病情恢复。药物使用时宜温服，以提高药效。综上所述，通过综合分析上述症状及证候特点，为临床治疗提供参考依据。||This article aims to explore the similarities and differences in clinical manifestations and treatment strategies between furuncles and epidemic febrile diseases. Studies have shown that the occurrence of furuncles is closely related to the dysfunction of the spleen and stomach, while epidemic febrile diseases often manifest as symptoms of the Sun or Taiyin syndromes. During treatment, it is necessary to focus on nourishing liver yin to improve the internal environment, and for patients with phlegm-dampness obstruction syndrome, corresponding measures should be taken to regulate organ functions and promote recovery. Medications should be taken warm to enhance their efficacy. In summary, by comprehensively analyzing the above symptoms and syndrome characteristics, this provides a reference basis for clinical treatment.

在中医理论中，拿揉法常用于调理脾胃功能，对于脾气亏虚证有着显著疗效。过逸则容易导致气血运行不畅，进而引发各种疾病。闻诊类是诊断疾病的重要手段之一，通过听患者的声音变化可以初步判断病情。在《黄帝内经》中提到的十二正经证类，更是全面涵盖了人体生理病理的各种表现。例如戴眼反折这一症状，常常提示病势危重；而点刺舌则是观察舌象变化的一种方法，对于诊断某些疾病具有重要参考价值。睑弦赤烂则多见于肝胆湿热或风热上扰之症，需结合其他症状综合分析。||In TCM theory, the rubbing manipulation is often used to regulate the functions of the spleen and stomach, showing significant effects on symptoms of spleen qi deficiency. Excessive idleness can easily lead to poor circulation of qi and blood, which may then cause various diseases. Auditory diagnosis is one of the important methods for disease diagnosis; by listening to changes in the patient's voice, the condition can be preliminarily judged. The twelve regular meridians mentioned in the Huangdi Neijing comprehensively cover various manifestations of physiological and pathological conditions in the human body. For example, the symptom of upward rolling of the eyes and stiffness of the neck often indicates a critical condition; while puncturing the tongue is a method to observe changes in the tongue, providing important reference value for diagnosing certain diseases. Redness and erosion of the eyelid margins are commonly seen in cases of damp-heat in the liver and gallbladder or wind-heat disturbing upward, and need to be analyzed in combination with other symptoms.

在中医理论中，卫行脉外的气与邪气相互作用是导致疾病的重要因素之一。例如，瘾疹的发生往往与外界风邪侵袭有关，治疗时需要通过解表攻下来驱除体表的邪气。同时，观察舌象中的染苔变化可以判断疾病的性质和进展，如湿热内蕴常表现为黄腻苔。在诊断过程中，我们还需关注患者的整体状况，包括阴阳平衡及五化状态。例如，阴虚火旺的患者可能会出现舌红少津，治疗上需注重滋阴降火。此外，开呼合吸的呼吸调养也是辅助治疗的重要环节，有助于改善肺功能，促进气血运行。||In TCM theory, the interaction between the qi circulating outside the meridians and pathogenic factors is one of the important factors leading to diseases. For example, the occurrence of urticaria is often associated with external wind pathogen invasion; during treatment, it is necessary to expel the pathogenic factors on the body surface through exterior-releasing and pathogen-expelling methods. At the same time, observing changes in tongue coating can help determine the nature and progression of diseases; for instance, internal damp-heat is often manifested by yellow, greasy coating. During diagnosis, we also need to pay attention to the patient's overall condition, including yin-yang balance and the state of the five transformations. For example, patients with yin deficiency and hyperactivity of fire may present with red tongue with little moisture, and treatment should focus on nourishing yin and reducing fire. Additionally, respiratory regulation involving opening and closing of breaths is an important part of auxiliary treatment, which helps improve lung function and promote the circulation of qi and blood.

For some symptoms of physical weakness caused by long-term pneumoconiosis, we can enhance physical fitness by strengthening yang, while using a gua sha board for local scraping to help restore the buttock area. Additionally, for certain benign tumors such as sarcomas, traditional Chinese medicine also has unique treatment methods. Through the aforementioned comprehensive approaches, we can effectively improve the patient's overall health condition.

在探讨鼻病类疾病时，我们注意到鼻疳作为一种常见病症，其发生与两仪失衡密切相关。据《黄帝内经》记载，人体阴阳平衡是健康之本，而鼻病的发生则常源于阴阳失调。本文旨在通过分析初关阶段的临床表现，结合气能摄血理论，探讨汤剂在治疗鼻疳中的应用。研究表明，合理运用石蛾等药材配伍的汤剂，可以有效改善鼻疳症状，恢复患者健康。同时，对于痹证的治疗亦有启示，提示我们在临床实践中重视药物的选择与配伍。通过对上述理论与实践的综合分析，本文进一步论证了中医辨证施治在鼻病治疗中的重要性。||When discussing nasal diseases, we note that nasal carbuncle, as a common condition, is closely related to the imbalance of yin and yang. According to the Huangdi Neijing, the balance of yin and yang in the human body is the foundation of health, while the occurrence of nasal diseases often originates from the disharmony of yin and yang. This article aims to explore the application of decoctions in treating nasal carbuncles by analyzing the clinical manifestations at the initial stage, combined with the theory of qi controlling blood. Research shows that the reasonable use of decoctions prepared with herbal combinations such as stone silkworm can effectively improve the symptoms of nasal carbuncles and restore patients' health. At the same time, it also provides enlightenment for the treatment of arthralgia, suggesting the importance of paying attention to the selection and combination of drugs in clinical practice. Through a comprehensive analysis of the above theories and practices, this article further demonstrates the importance of syndrome differentiation and treatment in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of nasal diseases.

同名经配穴法是中医针灸治疗中的重要方法之一，通过选取同名经上的穴位进行治疗。比如，在温病治疗过程中，我们可以采用此法配合使用补阳药来增强疗效。同时，根据患者的具体情况，我们还可以选择使用直刺或留罐法以达到更好的治疗效果。值得注意的是，心其华在面，说明面部皮肤状态与心脏健康密切相关，因此在治疗时也需关注面部的变化。此外，手太阳小肠经和同岁会也是我们在临床实践中常用的几个概念，它们在整体治疗方案中发挥着不可替代的作用。||The method of selecting acupoints on homonymous meridians is one of the important methods in TCM acupuncture treatment. For example, during the treatment of febrile diseases, we can use this method in combination with the administration of yang-supplementing drugs to enhance therapeutic effects. At the same time, according to the patient's specific condition, we can also choose to use direct insertion or cupping techniques for better therapeutic results. It is noteworthy that the luster of the heart is manifested on the face, indicating that the facial skin condition is closely related to heart health; therefore, changes in the face should also be taken into account during treatment. Additionally, the Small Intestine Meridian of Hand-Sun and Tong Sui Hui are several concepts commonly used in clinical practice, playing an irreplaceable role in the overall treatment plan.

在中医领域中，对于寄生虫病类疾病的治疗，我们强调辨证论治的原则，通过细致的诊断来确定病因和病情的发展阶段，从而制定个体化的治疗方案。针对骨折病患者，在实施正骨手法如勾法的同时，还需结合内服药物，以促进骨骼愈合。对于干霍乱等急性病症，疏散外风是常用的一种治疗方法，旨在缓解症状并防止病情恶化。此外，对于肾痈这类疾病，我们除了采用相杀药物相互配合增强疗效外，还会注重患者的生活调理，确保治疗效果。||In the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine, for the treatment of parasitic diseases, we emphasize the principle of syndrome differentiation and treatment, determining the cause and the development stage of the disease through meticulous diagnosis to formulate personalized treatment plans. For patients with fractures, while applying manipulative techniques such as the hooking method, we also combine oral medication to promote bone healing. For acute conditions like dry cholera, dispersing external wind is a commonly used treatment method aimed at alleviating symptoms and preventing the condition from worsening.

在探讨精室瘀阻证与流痰的关系时，我们发现二者虽有不同，却也存在内在联系。流痰作为一种慢性疾病，常伴随寒战出现，而精室瘀阻证则多见于男性患者，表现为局部疼痛和不适。津血同源理论提示我们，人体津液与血液之间有着密切的关系，因此在治疗过程中需要注重润下，保持体内津液充足，避免干燥。同时，对于乳糜尿患者而言，这种理论同样适用，需注意调理饮食，避免食用过于油腻的食物。此外，藏象学说认为人体内部器官的功能状态可以通过体表变化反映出来，如蛇丹即带状疱疹的发生可能与体内某些脏腑功能失调有关。综合以上分析，在临床实践中应当灵活运用这些理论，以达到更好的治疗效果。||In discussing the relationship between Jingshi blood stasis syndrome and Liu Tan, we found that although they have differences, there is an intrinsic connection. Liu Tan, as a chronic disease, often occurs with chills, while Jingshi blood stasis syndrome is more common in male patients, characterized by local pain and discomfort. The theory of body fluid and blood being from the same origin suggests that there is a close relationship between body fluids and blood in the human body, so during treatment, it is necessary to focus on moistening and maintaining adequate body fluids in the body to avoid dryness. At the same time, this theory also applies to patients with chyluria, who need to pay attention to dietary adjustments and avoid eating overly greasy foods. Additionally, the Zangxiang theory posits that the functional state of internal organs can be reflected through changes on the body surface, such as the occurrence of snake dan, or herpes zoster, possibly being related to the dysfunction of certain internal organs. Synthesizing the above analysis, these theories should be flexibly applied in clinical practice to achieve better therapeutic effects.

By using the method of sour and sweet to transform yin, we can effectively improve our physical condition. Some people may experience symptoms of intestinal tuberculosis, which not only affects digestive function but also leads to skin issues like flaky sores. We can alleviate these symptoms by using methods to broaden the chest and benefit the diaphragm. At the same time, for those with a constitution that tends to be cold, appropriate yang tonification is necessary, but it's important to ensure the methods used are proper. In daily life, we can also strengthen our body and boost resistance by inducing sweating to warm the interior.

I still remember once, a friend accidentally got hurt by a pine caterpillar; the scene was truly worrying. Traditional Chinese medicine considers this within the scope of exterior-interior matching acupoint therapy, and acupuncture treatment can effectively alleviate symptoms. Speaking of physique, earth-type individuals should pay attention to conditioning and avoid overworking leading to liver qi deficiency. Additionally, in health preservation, one must consider eight aspects and not focus on just one. Finally, for chronic diseases like bone atrophy, doing more moderate exercises in daily life to strengthen the body is also very beneficial.

Mastering the fire control in decocting herbs is also crucial as it directly affects the efficacy of the medicine. Recently, I noticed that some friends have been feeling unwell due to long-term pathogenic factors, which can actually be improved through appropriate exercise, such as the small movement of gluteal muscle relaxation, which can help unblock meridians.

本研究旨在探讨邪热伤阴证与肺热炽盛证在食瘕患者中的临床表现及治疗策略。通过分析病例，我们发现此类患者常伴有肝阳上亢证，其主要症状表现为胸闷烦躁、口干舌燥等。针对上述证候，治疗时应注重行气散结以改善症状，同时辅以泻火攻下之法清除体内积热。此外，对于伴随出血症状者，推荐使用固崩止带剂以达到止血效果；而对于便秘患者，则需应用润下剂以促进肠道蠕动，从而实现整体疗效的提升。||This study aims to investigate the clinical manifestations and treatment strategies of the syndrome of evil heat injuring yin and lung heat exuberance in patients with food accumulation. Through case analysis, we found that such patients often present with the syndrome of liver yang hyperactivity, characterized primarily by symptoms such as chest stuffiness, irritability, dry mouth, and parched tongue. For the aforementioned syndromes, treatment should focus on promoting qi movement and dispersing nodules to alleviate symptoms, while also employing methods to clear internal heat through purgation. Additionally, for patients with accompanying bleeding symptoms, it is recommended to use consolidation and hemostasis agents to achieve hemostasis; for constipated patients, lubricating purgatives should be applied to promote intestinal peristalsis, thereby enhancing overall therapeutic effects.

最近在门诊中遇到不少外感咳嗽的朋友，他们往往因为季节变化而感到不适。对于这些朋友，我通常会采用点脊法配合留针拔罐来调理，效果颇佳。同时，也有些患者因为长期压力大，情绪波动导致的不育类病，治疗时我会用到阳中求阴的方法，帮助他们调节体内阴阳平衡。记得有一位患者，因为过度忧虑导致的恐胜喜，使得血室失和，我通过得神调理，最终使他恢复健康。生活中我们常常会遇到各种各样的健康问题，但只要我们找到合适的治疗方法，保持良好的心态，一切都会好起来的。||Recently, I have encountered many friends with external coughs in the outpatient clinic, who often feel unwell due to seasonal changes. For these friends, I usually adopt the method of acupuncture on specific spinal points combined with retaining needles and cupping, which yields excellent results. At the same time, some patients suffer from infertility-like diseases caused by long-term stress and emotional fluctuations; when treating them, I use the method of seeking yin in yang to help regulate their body's yin-yang balance. There was a patient who suffered from excessive worry leading to fear overpowering joy, causing disharmony in the blood chamber; I adjusted him through getting spirit regulation, ultimately restoring his health. In life, we often encounter various health issues, but as long as we find suitable treatment methods and maintain a positive attitude, everything will improve.

春季来临，万物复苏，大家在享受大自然美好景色的同时也要警惕疾病的发生。比如春天是花粉过敏的高发期，有些人还会出现鼻痔的症状，这时候我们就可以用辛温通窍的方法来缓解，帮助鼻子通畅。另外，春天也是吃野菜的好时节，但是大家要注意不要误食毒蕈，以免引起毒蕈中毒。同时，对于胆气亏虚证患者来说，春天也是需要特别注意调理身体的时候，可以适当食用一些具有清热解毒功效的食物，预防疖的发生。此外，体内留饮过多也会影响健康，我们可以从饮食和生活习惯上入手，调养好我们的决渎之官，保持良好的身体状态。最后，如果孩子出现天花的症状，家长也不要过于紧张，及时就医并配合中药治疗，大多数情况下都能得到很好的恢复。||With the arrival of spring, all things come back to life. While everyone enjoys the beautiful scenery of nature, they should also be vigilant against the occurrence of diseases. For example, spring is a high season for pollen allergies, and some people may even experience symptoms like nasal polyps. In such cases, we can use the method of pungent-warm penetration to alleviate symptoms and help clear the nose. Additionally, spring is also a good time to eat wild vegetables, but everyone should be careful not to mistakenly consume poisonous mushrooms to avoid mushroom poisoning. Furthermore, for patients with the syndrome of deficiency of gallbladder qi, spring is also a time when they need to pay special attention to regulating their body, and they can appropriately consume foods with heat-clearing and detoxifying effects to prevent boils. Moreover, excessive retention of fluid in the body can also affect health; we can start from diet and lifestyle habits to regulate our body's drainage organs and maintain good physical condition. Finally, if children show symptoms of smallpox, parents should not be overly nervous; timely medical treatment and cooperation with Chinese herbal medicine therapy can usually lead to good recovery in most cases.

燥邪侵袭人体易引发怔忡病，此时若伴有中焦虚寒证，则需采用温阳化饮之法调理，以免阳虚水停证加重病情。在治疗过程中，除内服药物外，还可结合按跷疗法促进气血流通，缓解战栗症状，同时避免使用峻下逐水药以防伤正气。||Dry evil invading the human body tends to cause palpitations, and if accompanied by deficiency of middle jiao cold syndrome, warming yang and transforming fluid method should be used for adjustment to prevent aggravation of yang deficiency and water stagnation syndrome. During treatment, in addition to oral medication, Qiaqiao therapy can also be combined to promote blood circulation and relieve tremor symptoms, while avoiding the use of potent diuretic drugs to prevent damage to vital energy.

在治疗血热证时，我们需注意火耗气伤津的情况，根据患者具体情况因地制宜选择治疗方法。对于痈疡病症，采用缪刺或远道刺等针灸方法，以达到提脓拔毒的效果。同时，在治痈疡法中，化和营也是重要手段之一，通过调和营血，促进疮疡恢复。||When treating blood heat syndrome, we need to pay attention to the situation of fire consuming qi and injuring body fluid, and choose treatment methods based on the patient's specific condition. For carbuncle diseases, methods such as Moxi puncture or distant channel puncture can be used in acupuncture to achieve the effect of promoting pus discharge and detoxification. At the same time, in the treatment of carbuncles, harmonizing the camp is also one of the important methods, which promotes the recovery of sores and ulcers by regulating the camp blood.

在临床实践中，我们观察到某些疾病晚期患者出现“回光返照”现象，此现象常与“中焦阴虚证”及“热盛伤阴证”密切相关。针对此类病症，“辨证论治”显得尤为重要，通过仔细分析病情，我们可以发现“肝郁血瘀证”亦是导致上述症状的关键因素之一。治疗上，需灵活运用中药方剂，例如采用“冷服”方式以减少药物对胃肠道的刺激，并结合针灸疗法，特别是“豹文刺”技术，以促进气血运行，缓解“肝郁血瘀证”。此外，从“五行胜复”的理论出发，我们还需考虑疾病的整体平衡，确保治疗方案既能针对当前症状，又能调整体内五行之间的相互关系，从而达到标本兼治的效果。||In clinical practice, we observe the "returning light" phenomenon in patients with advanced diseases, which is often closely related to "deficiency of yin in the middle jiao" and "exuberance of heat injuring yin." For such conditions, "treatment based on syndrome differentiation" is particularly important. By carefully analyzing the condition, we can find that "liver depression and blood stasis" is also one of the key factors leading to the aforementioned symptoms. In treatment, we need to flexibly use Chinese herbal formulas; for example, using the "cold administration" method to reduce drug irritation to the gastrointestinal tract, and combining acupuncture therapy, especially the "leopard pattern needle technique," to promote the circulation of qi and blood, alleviating "liver depression and blood stasis." Additionally, based on the theory of "mutual overcoming and mutual generating among the five elements," we also need to consider the overall balance of the disease, ensuring that the treatment plan not only targets current symptoms but also adjusts the interrelationships among the five elements within the body, thereby achieving both symptomatic and radical treatment effects.

暑伤津气证多见于夏秋之际，因高温导致体内津液亏损，若再感寒邪，则易形成寒凝血瘀证，表现为抽搐等症状。冬季则需防备冬瘟，此病多由外感寒邪引起，治疗时宜散寒化饮。若患者出现过期不产，亦可能与命门之火不足有关，此时需调和气血，以助分娩。怒则气上，情志不畅亦会影响脏腑功能，进而加重病情。||The syndrome of summer heat injuring body fluid and qi is often seen in late summer and autumn, due to high temperature leading to loss of body fluid. If one is then affected by cold pathogenic factors, it can easily lead to the syndrome of cold凝聚and blood stasis, manifesting symptoms such as convulsions. In winter, one needs to guard against winter epidemic diseases, which are mostly caused by external invasion of cold pathogenic factors; treatment should focus on dispelling cold and transforming phlegm. If a patient has delayed labor, it may also be related to insufficient fire of the life gate; at this time, it is necessary to regulate qi and blood to assist delivery. Anger causes qi to rise, and if emotional flow is not smooth, it will also affect the function of zang-fu organs, thereby aggravating the condition.

在治疗络穴相关疾病时，我们需注重化和营，通过适当的针灸手法如大泻刺来调整气血平衡，避免病证用药禁忌。对于妊娠转胞等特殊病症，应谨慎使用药物，以免影响胎儿健康。中消患者需注意饮食调理，避免过食辛辣刺激之物。针对小儿惊厥，应结合小儿体质特点，采用温和疗法。而寒痰证患者则需温化寒痰，调和阴阳。||When treating diseases related to the Luo points, we need to focus on transforming and harmonizing the Ying, adjusting the balance of qi and blood through appropriate acupuncture techniques such as Great Drainage needling to avoid medication taboos for the disease. For special conditions like pregnancy cystocoele, drugs should be used cautiously to avoid affecting fetal health. Patients with middle consumption need to pay attention to dietary adjustments and avoid overeating spicy and stimulating foods. For pediatric convulsions, gentle therapies should be adopted in combination with the characteristics of the child's constitution. As for patients with cold phlegm syndrome, they need to warm and transform the cold phlegm, and harmonize yin and yang.

中医理论认为，人体内部环境与外界环境相互作用，导致各种疾病的发生。例如，喉癣虽非致命，但因其反复发作，严重影响患者生活质量，其根源在于血燥证，治疗时需注重调和肠胃剂的应用，以达到标本兼治的效果。又如足跟痹，虽看似局部病症，实则与肾垂功能失调密切相关，治疗时不可忽视既病防变的原则。此外，阴刺之症亦不可轻视，此症常由胃热气逆证引起，治疗上应以调理脾胃为主，同时兼顾清热解毒。通过综合分析病因病机，才能制定出更为有效的治疗方案。||According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, the internal environment of the human body interacts with the external environment, leading to various diseases. For example, although throat leucoplakia is not fatal, its recurrent attacks significantly affect the patient's quality of life; its root lies in blood dryness syndrome, and treatment should focus on the application of harmonizing agents to achieve both symptomatic and radical treatment effects. As for heel arthritis, although it appears as a localized condition, it is actually closely related to the dysfunction of the kidney垂 (likely a typographical error for '肾', meaning kidney), and one must not ignore the principle of preventing changes in the course of the disease during treatment. Additionally, the condition of yin刺 (likely a typographical error for a specific term) should not be taken lightly; this condition is often caused by stomach heat and reversed qi syndrome, and treatment should primarily involve regulating the spleen and stomach while also considering clearing heat and detoxifying. Only through comprehensive analysis of the causes and mechanisms of the disease can more effective treatment plans be formulated.

最近有位朋友跟我诉苦说他总是单腹胀，感觉腹部胀满不适，这在中医看来可能是因为决渎之官不畅所致。我告诉他日常生活中要注意饮食习惯，避免过食寒凉食物，因为寒者热之，调整体质才是根本。他还提到有时候会感觉身体不适，好像有四两拨千斤的感觉，我分析可能是由于心肝血瘀证导致的，建议他可以适当做一些促进血液循环的运动。另外，他最近工作压力大，经常熬夜，导致伤津，出现口干舌燥的症状，这也加重了他的症状，尤其是出现了重舌的情况，这些都是需要我们重视的。希望我的建议能帮助到他，也提醒大家在生活中要注意调养身体，五行相侮，保持良好的生活习惯。||Recently, a friend complained to me that he always feels bloated in the abdomen, with a feeling of fullness and discomfort. In traditional Chinese medicine, this may be due to the dysfunction of the triple energizer. I told him to pay attention to his dietary habits in daily life, avoiding excessive consumption of cold foods, because "cold should be treated with heat", and adjusting his constitution is fundamental. He also mentioned sometimes feeling unwell, as if the body was struggling under great pressure, which I analyzed might be caused by blood stasis in the heart and liver, and suggested he could do some exercises to promote blood circulation appropriately. Additionally, he has been under great work pressure recently, often staying up late, leading to fluid depletion, and symptoms such as dry mouth and tongue. This has worsened his condition, especially the symptom of a swollen tongue, all of which we need to take seriously. I hope my suggestions can help him, and also remind everyone to pay attention to nurturing their bodies in daily life, maintaining the balance of the five elements and good living habits.

中医认为，人体有八体之说，通过调和这些部位的功能，可以达到治疗疾病的目的。例如，在治疗肝气犯胃证时，我们采用化瘀生新的方法，促进气血运行，同时运用涤痰破结的手段，清除体内痰湿，使脾胃功能恢复正常。在某些情况下，血虚风燥证也会出现，此时需要滋养真阴，散寒燥湿，以恢复机体平衡。通过这些综合治疗方法，可以有效地改善患者的症状，提高生活质量。||In traditional Chinese medicine, there is a theory of the eight limbs, and by harmonizing the functions of these parts, the purpose of treating diseases can be achieved. For example, when treating the syndrome of liver qi invading the stomach, we adopt the method of resolving stasis and generating new blood to promote the circulation of qi and blood, while using the means of eliminating phlegm and breaking up nodules to clear phlegm-dampness in the body, allowing the functions of the spleen and stomach to return to normal. In some cases, the syndrome of blood deficiency and wind-dryness may also occur; at this time, it is necessary to nourish the true yin, dispel cold and dry dampness, to restore the balance of the body. Through these comprehensive treatment methods, patients' symptoms can be effectively improved, and their quality of life enhanced.

在探讨肺热炽盛证与肺实热证之辨析时，我们发现两者虽均表现为发热、咳嗽等症状，但肺热炽盛证常伴有脓疱疮，而肺实热证则以短脉为主要体征。临床观察显示，悲伤肺可导致气机不畅，进一步发展为留饮。此外，在暑温季节，外感暑邪亦可诱发上述诸症，且需注意和合四象理论指导下的综合治疗策略，以期达到调和阴阳、扶正祛邪的目的。||When discussing the differentiation between Lung Heat Excess Syndrome and Lung Solid Heat Syndrome, we find that although both manifest symptoms such as fever and cough, Lung Heat Excess Syndrome often accompanies carbuncles, while Lung Solid Heat Syndrome is characterized primarily by a short pulse. Clinical observations show that sadness in the lung can lead to stagnation of qi, which further develops into retained fluid. Additionally, during the season of summer heat, external invasion of summer pathogenic factors can also trigger these symptoms, and it is necessary to pay attention to comprehensive treatment strategies guided by the theory of the Fourfold Unity, with the aim of harmonizing yin and yang and strengthening the healthy while expelling the evil.

在探讨哮喘病时，我们发现指切进针法对于缓解症状有显著效果。然而，针对某些患者出现的真实假虚证，仅此方法可能不足，还需结合祛痰化湿和开窍等综合疗法。对于胃火旺盛引起的不适，适当调整饮食结构，减少辛辣刺激食物，亦是治疗的关键。此外，男性患者中滑精现象较为常见，这与肾气不固有关。阴疮与腋痈作为外科疾病，在临床中亦需重视，其治疗往往需要内外兼治，方能达到理想疗效。||When discussing asthma, we found that the finger-cut insertion technique has significant effects in alleviating symptoms. However, for some patients presenting with true-false deficiency syndromes, this method alone may be insufficient and should be combined with comprehensive therapies such as phlegm-eliminating and dampness-transforming, and orifice-opening treatments. For discomfort caused by excessive stomach fire, appropriately adjusting the diet structure to reduce spicy and stimulating foods is also key to treatment. Additionally, nocturnal emission is relatively common among male patients, which is related to kidney qi not being firmly retained. As external surgical diseases, yin sores and axillary abscesses also require attention in clinical practice; their treatment often needs both internal and external therapies to achieve ideal therapeutic effects.

在探讨中医养生与治疗的过程中，我们常提及“太极拳流派”对于调和气血的重要性，它不仅有助于促进“气血两清剂”的流通，还能增强体质。“心血亏虚证”患者常伴有面色苍白、心悸等症状，通过练习特定的“太极拳流派”，结合服用具有补益心气功效的药物，可以有效改善症状。而“脾积痞气”则往往源于饮食不当，导致脾胃功能失调，出现腹胀、食欲不振等表现。值得注意的是，“下石疽”是一种较为严重的皮肤病，表现为局部红肿热痛，治疗时需辨证施治，避免使用过于温燥的药物。同时，保持良好的生活习惯，适当锻炼如练习“太极拳流派”，对预防此类疾病也大有裨益。对于“热证”患者，则应避免食用辛辣刺激性食物，以免加重病情。综上所述，通过合理的生活调理与适当的药物治疗，可以有效改善上述病症。||In discussing Chinese medicine health preservation and treatment, we often mention the importance of "Tai Chi Quan schools" in regulating qi and blood; not only does it help promote the circulation of "qi and blood clearance agents," but it also enhances physical fitness. Patients with "deficiency of heart blood syndrome" often exhibit symptoms such as pale complexion and palpitations. By practicing specific "Tai Chi Quan schools" and taking drugs that have the effect of tonifying heart qi, symptoms can be effectively improved. "Aggregation of spleen qi" often originates from improper diet, leading to dysfunction of the spleen and stomach, manifesting as abdominal distension and loss of appetite. It is worth noting that "lower stone carbuncle" is a relatively serious skin disease, characterized by local redness, swelling, heat, and pain. During treatment, syndrome differentiation should be applied to avoid using overly warm and drying drugs. At the same time, maintaining good living habits and moderate exercise, such as practicing "Tai Chi Quan schools," can greatly benefit the prevention of such diseases. For patients with "heat syndrome," spicy and stimulating foods should be avoided to prevent aggravation of the condition.

The patient exhibited symptoms of cold pain, and after analyzing the pulse and tongue manifestations, was diagnosed with summer-heat disease, accompanied by lung heat and fluid injury syndrome as well as the syndrome of counterflow into the pericardium. According to "The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic," "Blood is the mother of qi," therefore, in treatment, it is necessary to regulate both qi and blood, using methods to dispel summer-heat and clear heat, supplemented with yin-nourishing and body fluid-generating substances. At the same time, considering the syndrome of excessive heart and liver fire, it is also important to focus on clearing the heart and purging the liver during treatment to achieve the effect of treating both the symptoms and root cause. Furthermore, for cases where the pathogenic factors have not been completely eliminated, corresponding measures should be taken at appropriate times to prevent recurrence of the condition. In summary, the diagnosis and treatment of summer-heat disease require consideration of multiple factors to achieve good therapeutic outcomes.

在这春意盎然的季节里，我们来聊聊中医里的十天干与人体健康的关联。中医认为，十天干不仅对应着自然界的五行变化，还与我们的十二正经息息相关。比如在调理身体时，若遇到骨槽风这样的病症，就需要通过清化三焦热的方法来治疗。而在日常生活中，保持良好的生活习惯，如溜臀等动作，可以促进气血流通，达到和营生新的效果。同时，在情绪管理上也要注意，避免过度悲伤，因为悲则气消，不利于健康。当然，有时候为了达到更好的治疗效果，涌吐开关也是不可或缺的一种方法。总之，中医讲究的是整体观念，让我们在生活中细心体会这些理论的应用吧。||In this season of vibrant spring, let's discuss the relationship between the ten heavenly stems in Traditional Chinese Medicine and human health. TCM holds that the ten heavenly stems not only correspond to the five elements' changes in nature but are also closely related to our twelve regular meridians. For example, when adjusting the body, if encountering a condition like bone slot wind, it requires treatment through clearing and transforming the heat of the triple energizer. In daily life, maintaining good living habits, such as actions like gluteus maximus stretching, can promote the circulation of qi and blood, achieving the effect of harmonizing the camp and generating new cells. At the same time, attention should be paid to emotional management, avoiding excessive sadness, because sadness depletes qi, which is detrimental to health. Of course, sometimes to achieve better therapeutic effects, inducing vomiting is an indispensable method. In short, TCM emphasizes the holistic concept; let us carefully experience the application of these theories in life.

在日常生活中，我们常常会遇到一些看似平常却暗藏玄机的身体状况。比如有些人可能因为胎毒蕴热证而出现皮肤问题，还有一些人可能会因为痰热壅肺证而感到呼吸不畅。中医认为，肺在液为涕，所以当肺部出现问题时，鼻涕也会变得异常。对于男性朋友来说，壮阳也是关注的重点，适当的调理可以帮助改善生活质量。而在治疗某些疾病如痴呆病时，可以尝试使用激光针这样的现代技术结合传统疗法。当然，在治疗过程中，也要注意开合，即调节身体的阴阳平衡，避免痰闭心窍证的发生。通过这些方法，我们可以更好地维护自身的健康。||In daily life, we often encounter some seemingly ordinary but subtly intricate physical conditions. For example, some people may develop skin problems due to the syndrome of retained heat from fetal toxicity, while others might feel shortness of breath because of the syndrome of phlegm-heat congesting the lungs.

For male friends, strengthening yang energy is also a focus, and appropriate regulation can help improve quality of life. In treating certain diseases such as dementia, modern technologies like laser needles can be tried in combination with traditional therapies.

For certain diseases, such as "stomach dryness and deficiency of body fluids syndrome," characterized by symptoms like dry mouth and tongue, and constipation, treatment can employ the method of "harmonizing the exterior and interior" to regulate organ functions. For "liver heat stirring wind syndrome," emphasis should be placed on clearing liver heat and reducing fire, as well as calming the liver and extinguishing wind. Additionally, "heart-related syndromes" are also commonly seen in clinical practice and require symptomatic treatment. As for the condition "troubled thinking," it is often associated with emotional stagnation and can be treated through psychological counseling combined with medication. In some specific cases, such as using the "round sharp needle" therapy, effective relief of symptoms can be achieved. Finally, "salt-separated moxibustion," one of the external therapies, has unique therapeutic effects on certain cold-deficiency diseases.

在探讨中医治疗原则时，我们常提到“相须”这一概念，即两种功效相似或互补的药物配合使用以增强疗效。例如，在处理“心肺阴虚证”时，采用“滋阴清热”的方法可以有效改善症状。而对于“泄泻病”，中医主张“温下实寒”，通过温补来调整体内阴阳平衡。值得注意的是，“脾积气”是导致消化不良的重要因素之一，治疗时需注重调理脾胃。此外，“先天之本”指的是肾，肾功能的好坏直接影响人体健康，因此在治疗过程中也需加以重视。“清胃降火”和“温下实寒”则是在不同体质下常用的治疗方法，前者适用于胃火旺盛的情况，后者则针对体内寒湿过重的问题。综上所述，中医治疗不仅需要辨证施治，还要结合患者的具体情况，灵活运用各种治疗方法。||When discussing the principles of TCM treatment, we often mention the concept of "xiang xu," which refers to the combined use of two drugs with similar or complementary effects to enhance therapeutic efficacy. For example, when dealing with "heart and lung yin deficiency syndrome," using the method of "nourishing yin and clearing heat" can effectively improve symptoms. As for "diarrhea disease," TCM advocates "warming and reinforcing yang to eliminate coldness," adjusting the body's yin-yang balance through warming tonification. It is worth noting that "accumulated qi in the spleen" is one of the important factors leading to indigestion, and it is necessary to focus on regulating the spleen and stomach during treatment. Additionally, "the root of innate constitution" refers to the kidney, and the health of the kidney function directly affects human health, so it must also be given due attention in the treatment process. "Clearing the stomach and reducing fire" and "warming and reinforcing yang to eliminate coldness" are commonly used treatment methods under different constitutions; the former is suitable for cases of excessive stomach fire, while the latter targets problems of excessive internal cold dampness. In summary, TCM treatment not only requires syndrome differentiation and treatment but also needs to combine the patient's specific conditions and flexibly apply various treatment methods.

在探讨肝热阴虚证时，我们发现平性药的应用对于调理体质具有独特效果。而在治疗厥病过程中，雁疮的识别与预防显得尤为重要。通过观察和研究十五络脉，我们可以更好地理解疾病的发生机制，并采用隔附子饼灸等外治法进行干预。此外，在某些情况下，使用逐水剂来调整体内水液代谢也是必要的，以达到主气调和的目的。这些方法共同构成了中医治疗复杂病症的重要组成部分。||In discussing the syndrome of liver heat and yin deficiency, we found that the application of neutral natured herbs has unique effects on regulating the constitution. During the treatment of syncope, the identification and prevention of gooseberry canker are particularly important. By observing and studying the fifteen collaterals, we can better understand the mechanism of disease onset and intervene using external therapies such as隔着附子饼灸. Additionally, in some cases, it is necessary to use water-expelling agents to adjust the body's water metabolism to achieve the purpose of qi regulation. These methods together constitute an important part of TCM treatment for complex diseases.

最近我遇到一位患者，他长期受冷凝肩困扰，行动不便，还伴有脱壳乳痈的症状，看起来像是中气不足导致的。我建议他平时多吃些能滋补脾阴的食物，同时配合一些运动来改善中气虚弱的情况。另外他的肘劲也不太好，走路时有些不便。我还发现他的皮肤上有一些热毒蕴肤证的表现，可能是体内湿气过重，需要好好调理。平时可以多做一些利耳的动作，帮助身体排毒。希望这些方法能够帮到他，也提醒大家注意日常保健，避免类似问题的发生。||Recently, I encountered a patient who has been suffering from frozen shoulder for a long time, with restricted movement and symptoms of peeling milk boil, which seems to be caused by insufficient central energy. I suggested that he eat more foods that can nourish the spleen yin in his daily life, while also combining some exercises to improve the condition of weak central energy. Additionally, his elbow strength is not very good, causing inconvenience when walking. I also found some manifestations of heat toxicity accumulating in the skin, possibly due to excessive internal dampness, which needs proper adjustment. He can do more actions that benefit the ears to help the body detoxify in daily life. I hope these methods will help him, and also remind everyone to pay attention to daily health care to avoid similar problems.

在探讨气阴亏虚证与落枕的关系时，我们发现运用验方结合佐助药治疗可以达到较好的疗效。同时，在日常保健中，通过练习太极拳拳理，不仅可以强身健体，还能预防因气阴不足引发的摇头及落枕等症状。对于已经出现的病症如落枕和摇头，采用标本同治的方法，从根源上解决瘕病的发生，提高患者的生活质量。||When exploring the relationship between Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome and torticollis, we found that using effective prescriptions combined with auxiliary drugs can achieve good therapeutic effects. At the same time, in daily health care, practicing the principles of Tai Chi not only strengthens the body but also prevents symptoms such as head shaking and torticollis caused by insufficient Qi-Yin. For existing conditions such as torticollis and head shaking, treating both the symptoms and root causes can solve the occurrence of the disease at its source, improving the patient's quality of life.

药膳在中医中不仅用于治疗疾病，还能够调理身体，比如针对妊娠偏头痛，通过合理的食疗可以有效缓解症状。然而，在临床实践中，我们发现某些疾病的治疗需要遵循逆治法，如对于足太阳膀胱经证引起的汗类病，逆治法的应用显得尤为重要。另外，阳黄病与饥疝也是常见的病症，它们可能由劳逸失度过大引起，需要通过综合调理来改善。||Medicinal diets are not only used to treat diseases in Traditional Chinese Medicine but can also regulate the body; for instance, for pregnancy-related migraines, proper dietary therapy can effectively alleviate symptoms. However, in clinical practice, we find that the treatment of certain diseases requires following the counter-treatment method; for example, for sweat-related diseases caused by Foot Sun Bladder Channel Syndrome, the application of the counter-treatment method is particularly important. Additionally, Yang Huang and Jixuan are common conditions that may be caused by excessive fatigue or idleness, and require comprehensive regulation to improve.

通过对《太极枪》的研究，我们发现其中蕴含的“掤劲”不仅是一种武术技巧，还与“脾肾气虚不固证”的治疗有着密切联系。临床观察显示，患者在治疗过程中，若出现“脏毒”症状，往往伴有“目眩”，同时，“产后恶露不绝”也可能与此有关。此外，在夏季高温环境下，人体易受“中暑”影响，导致上述症状加重，尤其是在“精室”功能失调的情况下。因此，结合《太极枪》中的理论指导，对于上述症状的综合调理具有重要的临床意义。||Through the study of "Tai Chi Gun," we found that the "Pengjin" contained within is not only a martial arts technique but also has a close relationship with the treatment of "spleen-kidney qi deficiency and instability syndrome." Clinical observations show that patients undergoing treatment often experience symptoms of "organ toxicity" accompanied by "dizziness," and "postpartum lochia not ceasing" may also be related to this. Additionally, in high-temperature summer environments, the human body is prone to being affected by "heatstroke," exacerbating the above symptoms, especially when there is dysfunction in the "essence room." Therefore, combining the theoretical guidance in "Tai Chi Gun," comprehensive regulation of the above symptoms has significant clinical implications.

在探讨肝郁脾虚证与寒滞胃肠证的临床表现时，我们发现两者常相互影响。通过输刺（五刺）等治疗方法，可以有效调整阴阳，促进本气恢复。对于风寒湿痹的患者，若治疗不当易转化为新感温病，此时需重视调整机体状态，防止出现回光返照现象，确保治疗方案的合理性和有效性。||When discussing the clinical manifestations of liver depression and spleen deficiency syndrome and cold coagulation and qi stagnation in the stomach and intestines syndrome, we found that the two often interact with each other. Through treatments such as bloodletting puncture (five needling), yin and yang can be effectively adjusted to promote the recovery of primary qi. For patients with wind-cold-dampness arthralgia, improper treatment can easily transform into new acute warm disease; at this time, it is necessary to focus on adjusting the body's condition to prevent the occurrence of a false sign of improvement, ensuring the rationality and effectiveness of the treatment plan.

在探讨热闭心包证与心阴亏虚证的区别时，我们发现两者虽同属心脏病变范畴，但其病理机制迥异。热闭心包证多由外感温热邪毒内陷心包所致，临床可见高热神昏等症状；而心阴亏虚证则多因劳心过度或久病不愈，导致心阴亏损，常见心悸失眠等症。治疗上，热闭心包证宜清热开窍，常用线剂如安宫牛黄丸；心阴亏虚证则需滋阴养心，可用天王补心丹等。此外，在针灸治疗方面，选取八脉交会穴如内关、公孙等穴位进行意气运动，可有效调节阴阳平衡。临床上还应注意辨别吞酸与阴黄病，前者多由肝胃不和引起，后者则属脾肾阳虚之象。对于肾气不固证患者，需重视固涩肾气，防止病情进一步发展。通过上述分析，我们可以更好地理解这些病症之间的联系与区别，从而为临床诊疗提供更为精准的指导。||When discussing the differences between the syndrome of heat closure of pericardium and the syndrome of deficiency of heart yin, we find that although they both fall within the category of heart disorders, their pathological mechanisms are distinct. The syndrome of heat closure of pericardium is often caused by the invasion of warm-heat pathogenic factors into the pericardium, clinically manifesting symptoms such as high fever and loss of consciousness; while the syndrome of deficiency of heart yin is mostly due to overwork or prolonged illness leading to depletion of heart yin, commonly presenting symptoms like palpitations and insomnia. In treatment, the syndrome of heat closure of pericardium should be treated with clearing heat and opening the orifices, commonly using decoctions like An Gong Niu Huang Wan; for the syndrome of deficiency of heart yin, nourishing yin and replenishing the heart is necessary, and Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan can be used. Additionally, in acupuncture therapy, selecting Eight Confluent Points such as Nei Guan and Gong Sun for qi movement can effectively regulate the balance of yin and yang. Clinically, it is also important to differentiate between acid regurgitation and yin jaundice, the former often caused by disharmony between liver and stomach, the latter indicating spleen-kidney yang deficiency. For patients with the syndrome of kidney qi not being consolidated, emphasis should be placed on consolidating kidney qi to prevent further deterioration of the condition. Through the above analysis, we can better understand the connections and distinctions between these syndromes, thus providing more precise guidance for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

最近有位朋友问我，他最近总是感觉身体发热，嗓子疼得厉害，而且咳嗽不断，尤其是晚上更为明显，整个人显得很疲惫。我初步判断他是出现了气血两燔证的症状，需要及时调理。同时他的咳嗽属于内伤咳嗽，建议可以试试解表宣肺的方法，帮助缓解症状。另外，他还提到自己经常感到耳鸣，这可能与肺主通调水道有关，需要注意肺部健康。此外，他体型偏胖，平时饮食不规律，可能会出现脾虚痰阻肺证的情况，这时候可以采用刮（柄）法来促进血液循环，改善痰阻肺证的问题。希望我的建议对他有所帮助，也提醒大家平时要注意饮食和作息，保持良好的生活习惯。||Recently, a friend asked me that he has been feeling hot all over, with severe sore throat and persistent coughing, especially more noticeable at night, making him feel very tired. I initially judged that he might be experiencing the symptoms of qi and blood both being overheated, which needs timely adjustment. At the same time, his cough belongs to internal injury cough, it is suggested to try the method of resolving exterior and promoting lung dispersion to help alleviate the symptoms. In addition, he mentioned that he often feels tinnitus, which may be related to the lungs' function in regulating water passages, so it is necessary to pay attention to lung health. Moreover, he is slightly overweight, and his irregular diet may lead to spleen deficiency and phlegm blocking the lungs, in this case, gua sha (scraping) can be used to promote blood circulation and improve the problem of phlegm blocking the lungs.

在探讨产后类病时，我们常会遇到肝肾虚火证与痰热蕴肺证等复杂情况，这些病症往往需要通过经络现象来理解其病理机制。对于这类病症的治疗，采用先补后攻的方法是较为稳妥的选择，即首先需调理好患者的体质，再进行针对性的治疗。同时，在治疗过程中，观察阴阳转化的规律也十分重要，这有助于更好地把握病情的发展趋势。值得注意的是，对于特定体质如太阴人而言，使用奇穴进行辅助治疗可能会取得意想不到的效果。这一过程不仅体现了中医辨证施治的原则，也是对传统医学智慧的一种传承与发展。||When discussing postpartum diseases, we often encounter complex conditions such as liver-kidney deficiency fire syndrome and phlegm-heat accumulation in the lungs; these conditions usually require understanding their pathological mechanisms through meridian phenomena. For treating such conditions, adopting a method of first replenishing and then attacking is a more prudent choice, which means first adjusting the patient's constitution before conducting targeted treatment. At the same time, observing the laws of yin-yang transformation during treatment is also very important, which helps better grasp the development trend of the condition.

最近在跟一位朋友聊天时，他提到自己总是感觉精神不振，有时还出现失神的情况。我告诉他这可能是肝为刚脏功能失调所致，建议他平时可以多做一些疏风化湿的运动，比如太极、八段锦等，同时饮食上也要注意清泄膈热，多吃一些蔬菜水果。他还说自己的手部皮肤出现了问题，有点像鹅掌风的症状，我建议他用抄法按摩手部穴位，并且保持手部干燥清洁，避免湿气加重症状。另外，如果感到心烦意乱，可以用解郁泄热的方法，如听音乐、散步等来调节心情，同时要注意固护阴液，不要过度劳累。||Recently, when chatting with a friend, he mentioned that he always feels lethargic and sometimes experiences absent-mindedness. I told him this might be due to the dysfunction of the liver's function as an organ of rigidity, and suggested that he could do more exercises to disperse wind and transform dampness, such as Tai Chi, Baduanjin, etc., while also paying attention to clearing and reducing chest heat in his diet by eating more vegetables and fruits. He also said that there was a problem with the skin on his hands, which looked like the symptoms of goose palm wind. I advised him to massage the acupoints on his hands using the copying method and keep his hands dry and clean to avoid exacerbating the symptoms due to increased dampness. Additionally, if he feels restless or agitated, he can use methods to resolve depression and reduce heat, such as listening to music, taking walks, etc., to regulate his mood, and at the same time, he should pay attention to consolidating and protecting his yin fluids and not overexert himself.

中医认为痴呆病的发生与气机不畅密切相关，风燥袭表证常导致气机失调，出现行气化痰之症，而津枯血燥则进一步加剧病情，使证候相兼，治疗时需采用温法以调和膀胱气化，促进体内气血运行，改善痴呆症状。||According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, the occurrence of dementia is closely related to the dysfunction of qi movement; the syndrome of wind dryness attacking the exterior often leads to dysregulation of qi movement, resulting in symptoms such as promoting the flow of qi and transforming phlegm. Moreover, the depletion of body fluids and dry blood further exacerbates the condition, causing concurrent syndromes. During treatment, warming methods should be used to regulate bladder qi transformation, promote the circulation of qi and blood within the body, and improve symptoms of dementia.

最近有朋友问我关于身体的小毛病，比如说发瘤和囊虫病，其实这些都是因为体内气血不畅造成的。在治疗上，我们常常采用活血祛风的方法，来缓解这些症状。记得有句话说“一身备五弓”，说的是人体就像一张弓，五脏六腑就像是弦，任何一个地方出现问题都会影响到整体。如果出现实寒证，我们需要解表攻里，同时对于一些太阳蓄血证的情况，也要注意清心利水，这样才能达到标本兼治的效果。||Recently, a friend asked me about minor physical ailments, such as goiters and cysticercosis; in fact, these are all caused by poor circulation of qi and blood within the body. In treatment, we often use methods to invigorate the blood and dispel wind to alleviate these symptoms. There is a saying that goes “the whole body has five bows,” which means that the human body is like a bow, with the five zang organs and six fu organs being like strings; any problem in one area can affect the entire system. If there is an excess cold syndrome, we need to resolve the exterior and attack the interior. At the same time, for some cases of blood stasis due to sun disease, it is also necessary to clear the heart and promote urination, in order to achieve the effect of treating both the symptoms and the root cause.

最近有一位朋友向我咨询，她身上出现了奇怪的蝶斑疮，非常困扰。我建议她可以试试以毒攻毒的方法，或许能缓解症状。当然，这种方法需要焗服特定的草药，才能达到最佳效果。同时，我也提醒她要注意身体其他部位的情况，比如阴道直肠瘘等，这些都可能是子病犯母的表现。如果出现持续的🗎热证，可能需要考虑用实则泻之的方式调理。当然，每个人的体质不同，具体方案还需要根据个人情况来定。||Recently, a friend consulted me about some strange butterfly spots that appeared on her body, which troubled her greatly. I suggested she could try the method of using poison to counteract poison, which might alleviate the symptoms. Of course, this method requires taking specific herbs to achieve the best results. At the same time, I also reminded her to pay attention to other parts of her body, such as vaginal rectal fistulas, which could all be manifestations of a daughter disease affecting the mother. If there are persistent hot symptoms, it may be necessary to consider regulating with the method of purging in cases of excess. Of course, everyone's physique is different, and specific plans still need to be determined based on individual circumstances.

在探讨血为气之母理论时，我们发现血虚会导致气虚，进而引发肺风痰喘等病症。针对此类情况，采用含有温燥病特性的药物治疗显得尤为重要。然而，在实际临床操作中，亦需警惕火邪过旺导致体内毒素积聚，形成所谓的毒蕈中毒现象，此乃内闭外脱证的一种表现形式。对于此类复杂病情，应用锭剂进行治疗不仅能够有效控制症状，还能促进气血调和，从而达到标本兼治的效果。同时，乳悬的应用也显示出其在改善上述症状方面的潜力。||When discussing the theory of blood being the mother of qi, we find that blood deficiency can lead to qi deficiency, which in turn can cause diseases such as pulmonary wind phlegm dyspnea. In such cases, it is particularly important to use drugs with warm-dry characteristics. However, in actual clinical practice, one must also be wary of excessive fire pathogen leading to toxin accumulation in the body, forming what is known as toxic mushroom poisoning, which is a manifestation of the syndrome of internal closure and external collapse. For such complex conditions, the use of pill formulations can not only effectively control symptoms but also promote the harmony of qi and blood, thus achieving both symptomatic and radical treatment.

在本次研究中，我们针对温邪侵袭肺卫证患者进行了详细的问诊与脉诊，发现其临床表现主要为自汗、咳喘等症。结合患者的症状和舌象，我们推测此症可能由胆经郁热证演变而来，治疗时需注重祛化浊，清泄胆经之郁热。同时，患者伴有嗳气、胃脘胀满等症状，提示可能存在脾胃功能失调，治疗过程中需兼顾调理脾胃。对于病情较重者，应辅以补血固脱之法，以防止病情进一步恶化。通过上述分析，我们认为温邪侵袭肺卫证的治疗应在辨证施治的基础上，注重整体调节，方能达到最佳疗效。||In this study, we conducted detailed inquiry and pulse diagnosis for patients with the syndrome of warm pathogen attacking lung and exterior defense, finding that their main clinical manifestations were spontaneous sweating, coughing, wheezing, etc. Combining the symptoms and tongue appearance of the patients, we speculate that this syndrome may have evolved from the stagnation heat in the gallbladder channel, and treatment should focus on removing turbidity and clearing the stagnation heat in the gallbladder channel. At the same time, the patients also experienced symptoms such as belching and fullness in the stomach, indicating possible dysfunction of spleen and stomach, and during treatment, it is necessary to adjust and regulate the spleen and stomach. For those with more severe conditions, blood tonification and consolidation methods should be supplemented to prevent the condition from worsening further. Through the above analysis, we believe that the treatment of the syndrome of warm pathogen attacking lung and exterior defense should focus on overall regulation based on syndrome differentiation to achieve the best therapeutic effect.

在探讨方剂学时，我们不仅关注其基本理论，还应深入分析各种病症的治疗策略。例如，对于少阴头痛与经前乳胀等妇科常见症状，通过调整脾肾亏虚证状态，可以有效缓解患者不适。此外，在面对炭疽或蚕豆黄这类急性病症时，准确判断脉象并结合惊证的辨识，对症下药显得尤为重要。这些治疗方法和理论均是中医临床实践中的宝贵财富。||When discussing prescriptions, we not only focus on its basic theories but also deeply analyze the treatment strategies for various diseases. For example, for common gynecological symptoms such as less yin headache and breast distension before menstruation, by adjusting the state of spleen and kidney deficiency, we can effectively alleviate patients' discomfort. Additionally, when facing acute diseases such as anthrax or favism, accurately judging the pulse and combining it with the identification of shock symptoms is particularly important to treat according to the symptoms. These treatment methods and theories are valuable assets in clinical practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

最近有朋友问我关于皮肤上的小疙瘩，也就是我们常说的疣目，这在中医看来往往和体内湿热有关。我通常建议他们从调理脾胃开始，同时结合一些外部治疗，比如使用捋法按摩局部促进气血流通。当然，如果伴有便秘问题，那么滋阴通下的方法就显得尤为重要了。而针对那些长期存在的顽痹，需要通过清热法来改善肝胃气滞证的情况，这样才能从根本上解决问题。另外，如果舌苔呈现霉酱苔的状态，那说明体内的湿气较重，这时候就需要调整饮食习惯，少吃油腻和甜食，多吃蔬菜水果，帮助身体恢复平衡。||Recently, a friend asked me about the small bumps on the skin, commonly known as warts, which in Traditional Chinese Medicine are often associated with internal damp-heat. I usually recommend they start by regulating their spleen and stomach functions while combining some external treatments, such as using the stroking technique to massage the affected area to promote blood and qi circulation. Of course, if there is also constipation, then the method of nourishing yin and promoting bowel movement becomes particularly important. For those long-standing stubborn cases, it's necessary to improve liver and stomach Qi stagnation through heat-clearing methods to address the root cause of the problem. Additionally, if the tongue coating appears to be moldy or dark yellow, it indicates that there is significant dampness in the body; at this point, dietary habits need to be adjusted, reducing intake of greasy and sweet foods, and increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits to help restore balance in the body.

For symptoms such as "lack of appetite despite hunger" appearing during pregnancy, we need to handle them with caution to avoid adverse effects on the mother and fetus due to improper treatment. At the same time, "taboos on medication during pregnancy" must be strictly followed, especially when using therapies like "induced vomiting". It is worth noting that the condition "flower madness" is occasionally mentioned in literature; although not unique to pregnancy, it requires particular attention during this period. Additionally, for certain specific conditions, such as "floating yang syndrome", special treatments like "short needling" may be required to adjust the balance of yin and yang within the body to achieve therapeutic goals.

I told him to maintain a pleasant mood and avoid emotional fluctuations as they might worsen his condition. Additionally, his tongue coating is somewhat thick and greasy, resembling a moldy sauce coating, which may indicate excessive dampness in the body. If there's no improvement, it's best for him to go to the hospital for a check-up to see if he has Heart Water Disease. In daily life, we can use long needles for simple self-massage to help dissipate the dampness in the body, while also paying attention to regular作息, ensuring adequate sleep, maintaining a balance between yin and yang in the body, especially allowing the yin within yang to get sufficient rest.

最近在看一些关于火热炽盛证的文章，发现很多人对于这种病症还是不太了解。其实，我们在日常生活中可以通过一些辛凉解表剂来缓解症状，比如菊花茶等。同时，如果体质虚弱的话，益气解表的方法也能帮助改善。说到体质，我想到的是肾精的重要性，毕竟肾精充足才能保持身体活力。记得有一次遇到一个病人，面色呈现真脏色，这通常意味着病情比较严重。我还记得他穿了一条尖裆裤，这个细节让我印象深刻。另外，水肿类病也是我经常遇到的问题，很多患者因为饮食不当导致水肿。通过指切进针法治疗后，他们的症状都有所缓解。希望这些知识能对大家有所帮助。||Recently, I have been reading some articles about the syndrome of intense heat, and I found that many people still do not understand this condition well. In fact, in our daily lives, we can alleviate symptoms through some pungent-cool exterior-releasing agents, such as chrysanthemum tea. At the same time, if one's constitution is weak, the method of invigorating qi and releasing the exterior can also help improve it. When talking about constitution, I think of the importance of kidney essence; after all, only with sufficient kidney essence can one maintain physical vitality. I remember once encountering a patient whose complexion showed a true organ color, which usually indicates a more serious condition. I still remember he was wearing a pair of pointed crotch pants, which made a strong impression on me. Also, edema-related diseases are a problem I often encounter; many patients develop edema due to improper diet. After treatment with the finger-cutting needling technique, their symptoms were alleviated. I hope these pieces of knowledge will be helpful to everyone.

TCM believes that difficult labor may be related to the physical constitution of the pregnant woman, such as kidney yin deficiency syndrome, which needs to be improved through regulation. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the strength of innate qi, as it is the foundation for maintaining life activities. The Bencao Gangmu records many herbs that can help us understand and solve these problems. Additionally, if there is a case of six yin pulses, it might indicate some blockage inside the body, requiring the release of exterior and eruption to help the body recover.

大家好，最近在研究中医古籍时发现了一种叫做“寸白虫病”的病症，据说是因为饮食不当导致体内寄生虫滋生。治疗这种疾病时，我们需要注意药材的“修制”，确保药物纯净有效。另外，如果出现“伪膜”现象，可能是病情加重的表现。在日常生活中，我们要避免“不内外因”引起的疾病，比如过度劳累或情绪波动。记得有位朋友曾提到过“劳疟”，这其实是由于长期劳作而引发的疟疾。还有，“关格”是中医术语，指的是上下不通的情况，如果严重到“脚气冲心”，那就需要及时就医了。最后，“迎随补泻”是一种针灸手法，有助于调和人体阴阳平衡。希望这些知识能帮助大家更好地了解中医，保持健康。||Hello everyone, recently while studying ancient Chinese medical texts, I discovered a disease called "Cun Bai Worm Disease," which is said to be caused by improper diet leading to the proliferation of parasites in the body. When treating this disease, we need to pay attention to the "Xiuzhi" of medicinal materials to ensure the purity and effectiveness of the drugs. Additionally, if the phenomenon of "weimó" appears, it might be a sign that the condition has worsened. In daily life, we should avoid diseases caused by "non-external or internal causes," such as overwork or emotional fluctuations. I remember a friend once mentioned "láomò," which is actually malaria triggered by prolonged labor. Furthermore, "guange" is a term in traditional Chinese medicine referring to a situation where there is an obstruction between upper and lower parts of the body; if it becomes severe enough to reach "jiaozíchōngxīn," then immediate medical attention is needed. Lastly, "ying sui bu xie" is an acupuncture technique that helps to harmonize the yin-yang balance in the human body. I hope these insights can help everyone better understand traditional Chinese medicine and maintain good health.

在日常生活中，我们经常会遇到一些常见的病症，比如小儿时令类病和痹病。这些疾病往往让人感到不适，比如胸胁苦满。治疗时我们可以考虑使用清热剂和祛风胜湿剂来改善症状。另外，如果出现舌象异常，可能是体内有热毒或寒湿，这时候可以选用合适的药物如化瘀止血药。最近听说有人因为饮食不当患上了钩虫病，这提醒我们在饮食上也要注意卫生，避免这类寄生虫病的发生。通过合理的调养和适当的药物治疗，相信大多数人都能恢复健康。||In daily life, we often encounter some common diseases, such as seasonal children's diseases and arthralgia. These diseases often make people feel uncomfortable, such as bitter fullness in the chest and flanks. When treating them, we can consider using heat-clearing agents and wind-dispelling dampness-removing agents to improve symptoms. Additionally, if there are abnormalities in the tongue appearance, it may indicate the presence of heat toxicity or cold-dampness inside the body; at this time, suitable drugs such as blood-stasis-resolving hemostatic drugs can be selected.

最近有朋友问我关于调理气血的问题，其实生活中我们经常会遇到一些小毛病，比如混合痔这样的问题，有时候饮食不当或者劳累过度就会出现，这时候我们可以用一些活血行气的方法来缓解，同时对于那些因为暴痢导致身体虚弱的情况，我们也可以采用类似的方法来调理。当然，如果是因为瘿劳或者其他精气不足引起的身体不适，我们就需要更加全面地调整生活习惯，包括饮食和作息，甚至可以尝试一些驱虫法来清除体内的寄生虫，以达到镇痉熄风的效果，从而更好地恢复健康。||Recently, a friend asked me about how to regulate the flow of qi and blood. In fact, in our daily lives, we often encounter some minor health issues, such as mixed hemorrhoids. Sometimes, improper diet or overwork can lead to these problems. At this time, we can use methods to invigorate blood and regulate the flow of qi to alleviate them. Meanwhile, for those whose bodies have become weak due to dysentery, we can also use similar methods to regulate their condition. Of course, if the discomfort is caused by yinglao or other deficiencies in vital energy and blood, we need to make more comprehensive adjustments to our lifestyle habits, including diet and sleep schedules.

For summer heat diseases, using the method of clearing summer-heat and detoxifying to alleviate symptoms is necessary, while also paying attention to the nourishment of acquired qi to ensure normal functions of spleen and stomach. For cold-solid accumulation in the chest syndrome, the treatment method of warming and dispersing nodules should be applied; while pulse arthralgia and wind arthralgia are caused by cold pathogenic factors and wind pathogenic factors respectively, and need to be treated by syndrome differentiation. Clinical observations show that patients often exhibit poor appetite, which is a sign of spleen-stomach weakness, and requires comprehensive adjustment combined with the theory of five transformations. Through the above analysis, it can be seen that the importance of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment lies in comprehensively grasping the cause and mechanism of the disease to achieve the goal of precise treatment.

For some spasm symptoms, such as "opisthotonos," it is necessary to alleviate them through "pacifying wind and relieving spasms." As for issues like "zongjin" and "pibi," according to traditional Chinese medical theory, these conditions often occur due to poor circulation of qi and blood; when treating them, it is not only necessary to regulate qi and blood but also pay attention to dietary habits and avoid "greasy and sticky" foods that can worsen the condition.

在探讨斑痧与药疹的鉴别诊断时，我们注意到两者虽均表现为皮肤异常，但斑痧多由外感时邪引起，而药疹则主要因药物反应所致。对于斑痧患者的治疗，需重视其舌象变化，尤其是假苔的观察，以判断病情进展及预后。此外，在脉诊方面，结脉常提示病程较长，病情较为复杂。针对此类病症，临床实践中应灵活运用和法，如散寒开闭、和络等方法，以达到调和阴阳、缓解症状的目的。特别值得注意的是，冬瘟作为一种季节性流行病，其防治策略亦应包括上述原则，尤其在冬季应加强预防措施，避免疾病传播。通过综合运用以上治法，可有效改善患者症状，提高临床疗效。||When discussing the differential diagnosis between erythema and drug eruption, we noticed that although both manifest as skin abnormalities, erythema is mostly caused by external pathogenic factors, while drug eruption is mainly due to drug reactions. For the treatment of erythema patients, their tongue appearance changes should be emphasized, especially the observation of false coating, to judge the progression and prognosis of the disease. Additionally, in pulse diagnosis, a nodal pulse often indicates a longer course of the disease and a more complicated condition. In clinical practice, flexible use of harmonizing methods such as dispelling cold and opening closure, harmonizing collaterals, etc., should be applied to achieve the purpose of balancing yin and yang and alleviating symptoms. It is particularly noteworthy that as a seasonal epidemic disease, the prevention and control strategies for winter epidemic should also include the above principles, especially strengthening preventive measures in winter to avoid the spread of the disease. By comprehensively applying the above therapeutic methods, we can effectively improve the patient's symptoms and enhance clinical efficacy.

在探讨经络之气与人体健康的关系时，我们不能忽视关门不利所导致的液代谢障碍，这常常引发五刺现象。隐痛作为常见症状之一，往往提示着脉痿的存在，而热蕴结证则是其背后的重要病理机制。阳脉之海的通畅与否直接影响到气血运行，进而影响身体各部位的功能状态。||When discussing the relationship between meridian qi and human health, we cannot ignore the metabolic disorders of body fluids caused by unfavorable conditions at the gate, which often lead to the wu ci phenomenon. Hidden pain, as one of the common symptoms, usually indicates the existence of pulse atrophy, while heat accumulation is an important pathological mechanism behind it. The unimpeded flow of the sea of yang meridians directly affects the circulation of qi and blood, thereby influencing the functional state of various parts of the body.

最近感受到天气变化无常，风善行数变，让人容易感冒。我采用拍法来促进血液循环，增强体质。同时，饮食上我也注重辛甘化阳，以补充体内阳气。朋友问我为何舌润，其实是因为我注重调理肾阴虚热证，使身体达到阴阳平衡。大家也要注意，季节交替时要保护好自己的经气，避免外界邪气入侵。日常生活中，我们还可以通过开阖补泻的方法来调节身体机能，提高自身免疫力。至于花剥苔，那是需要结合脉象和其他症状来综合判断的，这里就不展开说了。||Recently, I've felt the weather changing unpredictably, with wind changing frequently, making it easy for people to catch a cold. I use the slapping method to promote blood circulation and strengthen my physique. At the same time, in my diet, I focus on pungent-sweet transformation of yang to replenish the body's yang energy. A friend asked me why my tongue is moist; actually, it's because I focus on regulating kidney yin deficiency heat syndrome to achieve a balance between yin and yang in my body. Everyone should also pay attention to protecting their meridian energy during seasonal transitions to avoid external evil qi invasion. In daily life, we can also regulate bodily functions and improve our immunity through the opening and closing tonification and drainage methods. As for flower-peeled coating, it needs to be comprehensively judged in combination with pulse conditions and other symptoms, so I won't elaborate here.

She also mentioned that she is currently in the menopausal stage with significant mood swings and poor sleep quality. I suggested that she pay special attention to her daily diet, avoiding foods prohibited during pregnancy, and try to regulate her body by adjusting the distribution of qi between upper and lower parts of her body. Additionally, her tongue appears somewhat red, which might indicate the presence of cold phlegm congealing in her chest, requiring blood stasis resolution and harmonization of the stomach. If these methods can help alleviate her discomfort caused by bone erosion, that would be great. I hope my suggestions will be helpful to her.

在探讨养血润燥与清胃泄热之法时，我们发现其对于风邪外袭证的治疗效果显著，同时结合拿法等外治手段，能有效缓解症状。然而，在临床实践中，对于五志化火导致的内热炽盛，需辅以涌吐痰食之法以清除病灶。针对固脬止尿问题，我们注意到肛漏患者常伴有此类症状，故此二者在治疗策略上应予以综合考虑。通过上述分析，我们可以看出，中医学中的多种治疗方法在具体应用时需要相互配合，方能达到最佳疗效。||When discussing the methods of nourishing blood and moistening dryness as well as clearing stomach and reducing heat, we find that they have significant therapeutic effects on wind pathogen exterior attack syndrome, and when combined with external treatment methods such as grasping techniques, symptoms can be effectively alleviated. However, in clinical practice, for internal heat exuberance caused by the transformation of the five emotions into fire, the method of inducing vomiting to expel phlegm and food should be used to eliminate the lesion. Regarding the issue of consolidating the bladder to stop urination, we notice that patients with anal leakage often present with such symptoms, hence these two conditions should be comprehensively considered in treatment strategies. Through the above analysis, we can see that in traditional Chinese medicine, various treatment methods need to be coordinated with each other to achieve optimal therapeutic effects in specific applications.

When treating, the method of clearing and transforming the three burners' heat should be used to dispel evil from the body. Postpartum blood stasis rushing to the heart also needs to be guarded against; postpartum women are weak and susceptible, so attention should be paid to conditioning. If nipple damage occurs, do not take it lightly as it may lead to infection. Tense pulse is often seen during diagnosis, indicating coldness in the body. Yin cocoon formation is also related to cold-dampness and should be treated with warming yang and dispersing cold. The tapping technique is commonly used in massage to promote the circulation of qi and blood and alleviate symptoms.

在中医诊断中，切脉是判断疾病的重要方法之一，通过切脉可以了解体内气血运行的情况。对于蛊胀病症，我们常采用宣散浊气的方法来治疗，同时配合辛温发汗以促进体表邪气的排出。血风劳是一种慢性消耗性疾病，治疗上需要注重调养气血，防止余沥不尽的发生。而在处理石疽时，则需结合内外治法，既要清热解毒，又要活血化瘀，确保病情得到全面控制。肺藏魄，故肺部疾病的治疗也极为重要，需注重调理肺功能，以达到整体平衡。||In TCM diagnosis, pulse diagnosis is one of the important methods to judge diseases, through which we can understand the situation of qi and blood circulation in the body. For the treatment of guzhong syndrome, we often adopt the method of promoting the dispersion of turbid qi, while also using pungent-warm diaphoresis to promote the elimination of evil qi on the body surface. Xuefenglao is a chronic debilitating disease; in treatment, it is necessary to focus on regulating qi and blood, preventing the occurrence of residual dripping.

After thorough inquiry, I learned that he exhibited symptoms suitable for treatment with cool-dispersing exterior-releasing medicine. I also noticed that his eyelids were somewhat red and swollen, which might indicate the condition of blepharoconjunctivitis. Further understanding revealed that he had issues with blood not following its proper meridians, leading me to speculate that he might have been affected by external wind pathogen, requiring relief from summer heat and exterior-releasing treatment. Additionally, he mentioned often feeling abdominal fullness, suspected to be symptoms of ascites, while he also informed me that since his child's birth, he has had joint problems, which I suspect could be due to the condition of toxic pathogenic factors stagnating from fetal stage.

在探讨新感温病的过程中，我们发现该病症常表现为手太阴肺经证，患者可能出现口疮等不适症状。此外，若病邪进一步发展，可能会出现肝脾气滞证，甚至引发急淋或肝胆热证，此时治疗需注重清热解毒与调理气血。值得注意的是，部分患者因饮食不当，如过量饮酒，可能导致酒癖，此症与上述病症并存时，临床表现更为复杂，需细心辨证施治。而臭田螺虽非直接病因，但其性寒湿，易助湿生痰，对于已有湿热内蕴的患者而言，应避免食用。综上所述，对新感温病的治疗需全面考虑患者体质及病情变化，灵活运用中药以达到最佳疗效。||In exploring the new febrile disease, we found that it often manifests as symptoms of the Taiyin Lung Channel of Hand, and patients may experience discomfort such as mouth sores. Furthermore, if the pathogenic factors further develop, they may lead to stagnation of liver and spleen qi, or even acute leukemia or heat in the liver and gallbladder, requiring treatment focused on clearing heat and toxins and regulating qi and blood. It is noteworthy that some patients, due to improper diet such as excessive drinking, may develop alcoholism, which, when coexisting with the aforementioned conditions, makes clinical manifestations more complex and requires careful differential diagnosis and treatment. Although stinking snails are not direct causes, their cold and damp nature can easily generate dampness and phlegm; therefore, patients with internal damp-heat should avoid consuming them. In summary, the treatment of the new febrile disease must comprehensively consider the patient's constitution and changes in condition, and flexibly use Chinese medicine to achieve optimal therapeutic effects.

For "tooth bleeding" caused by damp-heat in the liver and gallbladder, using the "needle-cupping" therapy combined with heat-clearing and detoxifying drugs can effectively alleviate symptoms. At the same time, for "gastric reflux" conditions, based on the theory of five elements, the liver belongs to wood, while the spleen and stomach belong to earth; wood can overcome earth, hence excessive liver qi can lead to dysfunction of the spleen and stomach. Treatment should focus on regulating liver qi, supplemented by "bitter" drugs to purge liver fire, while also employing the method of "softening hardness and reducing swelling" to address liver hardening issues. It is noteworthy that the theory of "five organs' dislikes" reminds us in clinical practice to handle cases cautiously to avoid damaging the corresponding organ functions. In summary, when treating liver-related diseases, comprehensive use of various treatment methods can achieve the best therapeutic effect.

最近有一位朋友向我咨询关于面风痛的问题，说是面部经常出现阵发性的疼痛，让人十分困扰。我建议他可以试试无瘢痕灸的方法，这种方法不仅能够缓解症状，还不会留下疤痕。另外，如果是因为心气阴两虚证导致的心恶热，那么在治疗时应该注重祛痰化瘀，同时使用一些清虚热药来调理身体。当然，对于那些因为肝火旺盛引起的症状，如清肝泄热也是必不可少的。通过这些方法，相信他的症状会有所改善。不过，每个人的身体状况不同，具体治疗方法还需要结合个人体质和病情来确定。||Recently, a friend consulted me about facial neuralgia, mentioning that he often experiences intermittent pain in his face, which is very troubling. I suggested that he could try the scarless moxibustion method, which can not only alleviate the symptoms but also leave no scars.

在中医理论中，暑邪侵袭人体易导致暑耗气阴证，出现口渴、心烦等症状，治疗时需采用清热除烦的方法。而某些疾病发展过程中，由实转虚的现象较为常见，如消肾等病症，其治疗需要细心辨证施治。在临床实践中，通过望诊类方法可以观察到患者面色、舌象等变化，为诊断提供依据。同时，在处理复杂的胃肠道问题时，七冲门的概念尤为重要，它涉及消化系统的多个关键部位。对于一些难以用传统方法治疗的头痛，特别是厥阴头痛，鼻针疗法作为一种新的治疗方法，展现出独特的疗效。这些治疗方法和理论不仅丰富了中医的学术内涵，也为现代临床提供了更多选择。||In TCM theory, summer-heat pathogenic factors easily lead to the syndrome of summer-heat consuming qi and yin, manifesting symptoms such as thirst and irritability; treatment should adopt methods for clearing heat and eliminating irritability. In the course of certain diseases, phenomena of transforming from excess to deficiency are relatively common, such as in the case of deficiency kidney and other syndromes, requiring careful differential treatment. In clinical practice, through observation-based diagnostic methods like observing facial color and tongue appearance, changes can be observed which provide evidence for diagnosis. At the same time, when dealing with complex gastrointestinal issues, the concept of the Seven Apertures is particularly important as it involves several key parts of the digestive system. For some difficult-to-treat headaches, especially uterine headaches, nasal acupuncture therapy, as a new treatment method, demonstrates unique therapeutic effects. These treatment methods and theories not only enrich the academic connotation of TCM but also provide more options for modern clinical practice.

在中医理论中，风为百病之首，故治疗时需注重解表攻里，以祛除体内风邪。对于络穴的选择与针刺角度的把握尤为重要，这直接影响到疾病的治疗效果。如不寐一症，常因伏梁气郁结所致，此时可通过针刺特定络穴并调整针刺角度来调理。临床观察发现，患者若伴有黄苔，则表明病邪较重，需加强解表攻里之力。此外，在治疗过程中，应避免敞裆受凉，以防风邪侵袭，加重病情。||In Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, wind is considered the source of all diseases, so when treating, it is necessary to focus on resolving exterior and attacking interior to eliminate wind pathogen inside the body. The selection of collateral points and the control of needle insertion angle are particularly important, as they directly affect the therapeutic effect of the disease. For example, insomnia is often caused by stagnation of Qi due to retained turbid pathogenic factors, and at this time, it can be adjusted by needling specific collateral points and adjusting the needle insertion angle. Clinical observations have found that if the patient has yellow coating on the tongue, it indicates that the pathogenic factors are severe, and the power of resolving exterior and attacking interior needs to be strengthened. In addition, during the treatment process, one should avoid exposing the groin to cold to prevent wind pathogen from invading and worsening the condition.

在探讨乳疽之病理机制时，我们注意到其本质在于体阴而用阳的阴阳失衡状态，导致气血运行受阻，表现为血不循经。临床上，患者常诉说坐腿疼痛不适，此乃气血瘀滞于下焦所致。治疗上，宜采用散寒开窍之法，辅以补气药调节全身机能，促进气血流通。然而，医过亦需警惕，不当治疗可能导致病情迁延，甚至引发肛门臊疣等并发症，加重患者痛苦。此过程中，需精准辨证施治，方能奏效。||When discussing the pathological mechanism of mammary abscess, we noticed that its essence lies in the imbalance of yin and yang in the body, characterized by a state of substance being yin and function being yang, leading to obstruction in the circulation of qi and blood, manifested as blood not following its proper channels. Clinically, patients often complain of discomfort and pain in the legs, which is caused by stagnation of qi and blood in the lower energizer. In treatment, it is advisable to use methods for dispelling cold and opening the orifices, supplemented by qi-tonifying drugs to regulate the overall bodily functions and promote the circulation of qi and blood. However, excessive medical intervention also needs to be guarded against, as improper treatment may lead to prolonged illness and even complications such as anal warts, exacerbating the patient's suffering. During this process, accurate syndrome differentiation and targeted treatment must be applied to achieve efficacy.

最近有位朋友跟我抱怨，说自己最近总是感觉身体不适，有时候会出现耳鸣的情况，而且皮肤上还长了一些紫癜风，看着就让人心烦。我了解了下他的生活习惯，发现他工作压力很大，经常加班熬夜，饮食也不规律。我告诉他这可能是由于外感病因导致的气滞痰阻证，建议他可以试试一些温化寒痰剂来调理一下。但是他还出现了热盛动血证的症状，这就需要特别注意了，如果处理不当可能会出现热证转寒的情况，那样的话可能就需要用到一些补气药了。希望他能早日调整好状态，恢复健康。||Recently, a friend complained to me that he has been feeling unwell recently, sometimes experiencing tinnitus, and purple spots have appeared on his skin, which is very annoying. I learned about his living habits and found out that he has great work pressure, often works overtime and stays up late, and his diet is irregular. I told him that this might be due to Qi stagnation and phlegm obstruction caused by external pathogenic factors, and suggested that he could try some warm-phlegm transforming agents to regulate his condition. However, he also showed symptoms of heat exuberance stirring blood, which requires special attention. If not handled properly, it might lead to a situation where heat syndrome turns into cold, in which case some qi-supplementing drugs might be needed. I hope he can adjust his state as soon as possible and recover his health.

近日有朋友咨询关于胞宫血热证和心脉瘀阻证的问题，其实这与饮食不节有很大关系，长期饮食不规律容易导致体内湿热过重，引发血瘀证，甚至出现齿槽风等口腔问题。此外，儿童出现弄舌现象也可能是体内热毒的表现，家长需要留意。而百岁疮虽少见，但也是由少阴热化证引起的一种皮肤问题，需及时调理。日常生活中我们应当注重养生保健，避免这些症状的发生。||Recently, some friends have consulted about the problems of blood heat in the uterine and blood stasis in the heart meridian. In fact, this is closely related to irregular diet. Long-term irregular diet can easily lead to excessive internal damp-heat, causing blood stasis syndrome, and even leading to oral problems such as tooth槽wind. Additionally, children's tongue protrusion may also be a manifestation of internal heat toxicity, which parents need to pay attention to. Although centenarian sores are rare, they are also a skin problem caused by the transformation of heat in the lesser yin, and need to be adjusted in time. In daily life, we should pay attention to health preservation to avoid the occurrence of these symptoms.

最近在跟一位朋友聊天时发现她每次来月经都会出现情绪波动，这可能是经行情志异常的表现。我建议她平时可以多用缠法按摩穴位以缓解症状，同时要注意保暖，避免表寒肺热证的发生。如果感觉身体沉重，四肢无力，可能是因为脾阳不足导致的身重，这时候可以通过补益法调理，增强体质。另外，春季天气变化无常，很容易引发鼻鼽，也就是我们常说的过敏性鼻炎，平时可以用艾灸等方式来温通鼻窍。总之，通过这些简单的方法，我们可以更好地调整自己的身体状态，让生活更加健康美好。||Recently, while chatting with a friend, I found out that she experiences mood swings every time she gets her period, which might be a manifestation of menstrual emotional abnormalities. I suggested that she could massage acupoints using the binding method regularly to alleviate symptoms, and also pay attention to keeping warm to prevent the occurrence of exterior cold and lung heat syndrome. If she feels heavy in the body and weak in the limbs, it might be due to insufficient spleen yang causing body heaviness; in this case, she can adjust through the tonifying method to enhance physical constitution. Additionally, as the weather changes frequently in spring, it is easy to trigger nasal pruritus, which is what we commonly call allergic rhinitis. She can use moxibustion and other methods to warm and unblock the nasal passages. In short, by using these simple methods, we can better regulate our physical condition and make life healthier and more beautiful.

在探讨宽中化痰法治疗腿风之临床应用时，需辨明虚实真假，尤其针对月经后期患者，运用此法时须兼顾发表攻里之策略。此外，对于某些顽固病症，适度采用以毒攻毒之法亦不失为一种选择，但需谨慎掌握其剂量与时机。同时，在治疗过程中，关注根结所在，方能从根本上解决问题。最后，针对内热导致之润燥止渴症状，亦应在治疗方案中予以考虑，确保整体疗效。||When discussing the clinical application of the method of broadening the middle to resolve phlegm in treating leg wind, one must distinguish between deficiency and excess, reality and appearance, especially for patients with delayed menstruation, when using this method, strategies for resolving exterior and attacking interior should be taken into account. Additionally, for some stubborn diseases, moderately adopting the method of using toxicity to counteract toxicity is also a choice, but the dosage and timing must be carefully controlled. At the same time, during the treatment process, focusing on the root cause will enable solving problems at their core. Finally, for symptoms such as dryness due to internal heat causing thirst, they should also be considered in the treatment plan to ensure overall efficacy.

在中医理论中，手指同身寸是测量穴位的重要方法之一。风温与食物中毒虽病因不同，但均可导致人体元气受损，出现一系列症状。治疗时需注重益气，以恢复机体正气。若患者表现为寒滞肝脉证，则需温经散寒，调理气机。此外，皮肤疾病如松皮癣亦需辨证施治，调整气轮，促进气血运行。通过这些综合治疗方法，可以有效改善患者的体质，提高生活质量。||In Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, finger measurement is one of the important methods for measuring acupoints. Although the causes of wind-heat and food poisoning are different, both can lead to damage of the body's vital energy, resulting in a series of symptoms. During treatment, it is necessary to focus on invigorating qi to restore the body's normal vital energy. If the patient shows symptoms of cold stagnation in the liver meridian, then warming the channels and dispersing cold, as well as regulating the flow of qi, are required. Additionally, skin diseases such as pine bark psoriasis also need to be treated by syndrome differentiation, adjusting the qi wheel, and promoting blood circulation. Through these comprehensive treatment methods, the patient's constitution can be effectively improved, enhancing their quality of life.

在探讨脾肾不固证与阴胜则寒的病理机制时，我们发现肘劲与肉痹之间存在密切关联。临床观察显示，暴吐现象在骨折病患者中较为常见，这可能与内伤病因有关。治疗上，采用辛温解表法可以缓解症状，但需结合个体体质调整方剂，以达到标本兼治的效果。对于脾肾不固导致的诸症，辛温解表虽为常用之法，但仍需辨证施治，以防阴胜则寒之变。在处理骨折病并发肘劲与肉痹的情况下，应注重整体调理，避免单纯局部治疗导致病情迁延。||In exploring the pathomechanism of spleen-kidney deficiency and yin excess leading to cold, we found a close relationship between elbow stiffness and muscle stiffness. Clinical observations show that sudden vomiting is common in patients with fractures, which may be related to internal injury causes. In treatment, using pungent-warm exterior-releasing method can alleviate symptoms, but it is necessary to adjust prescriptions according to individual constitution to achieve both symptomatic and radical treatment effects. For various symptoms caused by spleen-kidney deficiency, although pungent-warm exterior-releasing is a commonly used method, syndrome differentiation and treatment should still be emphasized to prevent the transformation into yin excess leading to cold. When dealing with fractures complicated by elbow stiffness and muscle stiffness, overall regulation should be emphasized to avoid the prolongation of the condition due to purely local treatment.

最近天气炎热，不少朋友反映自己出现了小便黄赤的情况，这可能是体内湿热过重导致的。在中医看来，眼睛属于五轮之一的风轮，如果出现目眩的症状，可能与肝肾功能失调有关。另外，有些人脸上长了田螺疱，这在中医里称为一种皮肤病，通常和体内湿毒有关。我们平时要注意饮食，避免食用过于辛辣刺激的食物，以免引发急火攻心。同时，肺开窍于鼻，鼻炎患者要特别注意防护，避免吸入过多尘埃。对于女性来说，白带异常可能是因为固肾止带的功能受到影响，应该及时调理。最后，如果感觉喉咙不适，尤其是有异物感或疼痛，可能是喉岩的表现，需要及时就医检查。日常生活中，我们要保持良好的生活习惯，合理膳食，适量运动，才能保持身体健康。||Recently, many friends have reported that their urine has turned yellow or reddish, which could be due to excessive internal damp-heat. In traditional Chinese medicine, the eyes belong to one of the five wheels, the wind wheel. If there is dizziness, it may be related to the dysfunction of the liver and kidney. Additionally, some people develop snail blisters on their faces, which in TCM is considered a type of skin disease usually associated with internal damp toxicity. We should pay attention to our diet in daily life, avoiding overly spicy and stimulating foods to prevent internal heat. At the same time, since the nose is the opening of the lungs, patients with rhinitis need to pay special attention to protection and avoid inhaling too much dust. For women, abnormal leucorrhea might be caused by the impact on the function of consolidating the kidneys and stopping the discharge, and timely adjustment is needed. Finally, if you feel discomfort in your throat, especially with a foreign body sensation or pain, it might be a sign of laryngeal rock and requires prompt medical examination. In daily life, we should maintain good living habits, eat reasonably, and exercise moderately to maintain health.

在探讨痘疮的治疗过程中，我们发现脾胃阳虚证与胃热气逆证并存的情况较为常见。针对此类病症，采用输刺（五刺）疗法结合中药调理，可以有效改善症状。此外，对于某些复杂病例，如表现为厥阴病证和痉证时，需进一步辨证施治，确保水火既济，以达到阴阳平衡。值得注意的是，在治疗过程中，应避免过度使用可能伤及肾脏的药物，以防消肾之虞。综上所述，通过综合运用多种治疗方法，能够有效提升痘疮患者的临床疗效。||In discussing the treatment of smallpox, we found that the coexistence of spleen and stomach yang deficiency and stomach heat qi rebellion is relatively common. For such conditions, using the transfusion needling (five-needle) therapy combined with herbal medicine adjustment can effectively improve symptoms. Additionally, for some complex cases, such as those presenting with jueyin disease syndrome and spasm syndrome, further differentiation and treatment are needed to ensure water and fire balance, achieving yin-yang harmony. It is noteworthy that during treatment, excessive use of drugs that may harm the kidneys should be avoided to prevent kidney depletion. In summary, by comprehensively applying various treatment methods, the clinical efficacy for smallpox patients can be significantly improved.
