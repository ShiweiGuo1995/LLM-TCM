女性宫颈癌的发生与高危型人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染关系密切，及时有效地阻断高危型 HPV 感染对预防宫颈癌的发生有重要意义。黄元御的“一气周流”理论思想崇尚中土，注重整体气机的调畅，可阐释女性的生理病理。而高危型 HPV 感染的发生与中焦脾土失运，气机周流不畅，机体抗邪能力低下致清浊升降失常有关。基于“一气周流”理论结合“治未病”思想，笔者提出“未病先防，调畅中土存正气”“既病防变，升降相因祛毒邪”“瘥后防复，阴阳平衡和气血”的高危型 HPV 感染的防治原则，以期为临床治疗提供参考。,"The occurrence of cervical cancer in women is closely related to high-risk HPV infection, and timely and effective interruption of high-risk HPV infection is of great significance to prevent the occurrence of cervical cancer. Huang Yuanyou's theory of ""circular flow of Qi"" emphasizes on the harmonization of the overall Qi flow, which can explain the physiopathology of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is related to the loss of spleen and earth transportation in the middle Jiao, poor circulation of Qi, and the low resistance of the body to evil, resulting in the malfunctioning of clear and turbid. Based on the theory of ""circular flow of Qi"" combined with the idea of ""prevention treatment of disease"", the author proposes to ""prevent the disease before it occurs, regulate the middle earth to preserve the correct Qi"" and ""prevent the disease before it occurs"". The principles of prevention and treatment of high-risk HPV infection are ""prevent before the disease, regulate the middle earth to preserve the righteousness"", ""promote and descend to dispel the poisonous evil"", and ""prevent recurrence after the disease, balance yin and yang and harmonize Qi and blood"", in order to provide reference for clinical treatment."

The early pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) is deficiency of heart Qi and heart Yang and disorder in Qi transformation in triple energizer, while in the later stage of the disease, it progresses from deficiency to excess, with simultaneous occurrence of deficiency and excess syndromes. Fuling Guizhi Baizhu Gancao Decoction (Linggui Zhugan Decoction) plays its role in treating chronic heart failure by the four elements of ""property, position, tendency and syndrome"". Property—Linggui Zhugan Decoction is pungent, sweet, slight sweet and bitter in flavor, but warm in property. The sweet is able to tonify deficiency; the pungent is responsible for dispersing Yang, promoting Qi and draining water retention; the warm nourishes the spleen, raises Yang Qi and resolves phlegm; the bitter could excrete diuresis and dry dampness to guarantee the smooth operation of three energizer. Position-Linggui Zhugan Decoction acts on the heart, spleen and triple energizer. It can stimulate heart Yang, strengthen the spleen, resolve phlegm, and regulate the waterways to promote the Qi transformation in triple energizer. Tendency-The tendency of Linggui Zhugan Decoction is upward and downward in parallel, both internal and external. Warming up and promoting diuresis, raising Yang up and tonifying deficiency, it is conducive to the Yang Qi transformation in triple energizer. Syndrome-Linggui Zhugan Decoction is indicated for the syndrome of heart Yang deficiency and water-fluid retention, which begins with the upper abdomen swelling, Qi rushes against the chest. It is widely used in the treatment of water-vapor impulse heart disease. The disorder of Qi transformation in triple energizer is the main mechanism of recurrent CHF. Linggui Zhugan Decoction can not only warm the fire of Qi transformation in triple energizer, but also smooth the pathway of Qi transformation in triple energizer, which is compatible with the treatment of systemic fluid retention in chronic heart failure. Its pharmacological mechanisms include anti-inflammation, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of cardiomyocyte cell membrane ion channels, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury and modulation of vasodilation, etc. Deconstructing Linggui Zhugan Decoction with ""four-in-one"" approach and discussing its mechanism for treating CHF in combination with the theory of ""Qi transformation in triple energizer"", have great significance to rejuvenate the vitality of classical prescriptions and to apply them accurately and effectively."

尿毒症瘙痒（UP）是终末期肾脏病患者常见并发症，严重降低患者生活质量。中医外治法治疗 UP 相较于中药内治法操作简便、起效迅速，且能避免口服药物所致首关效应及可能带来肝肾损伤，治疗手段主要包括中药外洗、药浴、熏洗、湿敷、灌肠、刮痧、针刺、耳穴贴压、穴位敷贴、穴位离子导入、自体血穴位注射等。目前，多数研究在西医常规治疗基础上加用中医外治法，可提高疗效，在改善瘙痒症状、炎症指标、睡眠质量及焦虑抑郁状态等方面具有一定优势；一些研究选取甲状旁腺激素、血磷、CRP、IL-6、组胺、SCr、BUN、β2-微球蛋白等指标评价疗效，结果提示中医外治法可改善患者微炎症状态，保护肾功能，但其作用机制有待进一步研究。现有研究存在以下问题：临床疗效评价量表不统一，难以横向比较和总结；瘙痒症状的缓解依据量表评判，主观性较强；研究疗程较短，无法评判远期疗效和安全性；部分研究未指明患者证型，难以体现中医辨证论治优势等，今后还需完善。,"Uremic pruritus (UP) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, which seriously reduces the quality of life of patients. Compared with the internal treatment of TCM, the external treatment of TCM for UP is simpler and more effective, and can avoid the first pass effect caused by oral drugs and may cause liver and kidney damage. The treatment methods mainly include external washing of TCM, medicated bath, fumigation, wet compress, enema, scraping, acupuncture, auricular point sticking, acupoint application, acupoint iontophoresis, autologous blood acupoint injection and so on. At present, most studies are based on the conventional treatment of Western medicine, and the addition of external treatment of TCM can improve the efficacy, and has certain advantages in improving itching symptoms, inflammatory indicators, sleep quality, anxiety and depression. Some studies have selected parathyroid hormone, blood phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, β2-microglobulin and other indicators to evaluate the efficacy. The results suggest that external treatment of TCM can improve the micro-inflammatory state of patients and protect renal function, but further mechanism research is needed. The existing research has the following problems: the clinical efficacy evaluation scale is not uniform, and it is difficult to compare and summarize horizontally; the relief of pruritus symptoms is based on the scale evaluation, which is subjective; the course of treatment is short, and the long-term efficacy and safety can not be evaluated; some studies do not specify the patients' syndrome type, which is difficult to reflect the advantages of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, and needed to be improved in the future."

The ""Xingnao Kaiqiao"" is the core of the theory of the ""Tiaoshen"", the acupuncture of ""Xingnao Kaiqiao"" was based on the principle of ""Xingnao"",""Xingshen"" and ""Tiaoshen"", the idea of the ""Tiaoshen"" was inseparable from the diagnosis and treatment of the TCM encephalopathy. Based on the special features of acupuncture therapy and complexity and particularity of TCM encephalopathy, acupuncture and moxibustion treatment of encephalopathy was supposed to have their own unique system of syndrome differentiation and treatment. During the practice of acupuncture, the diagnosis and treatment of TCM encephalopathy should be based on ""brain"", ""Xingnao Tiaoshen"" as a general rule, adding and subtracting from the main points of the ""Xingnao Kaiqiao"", and the different brain diseases are matched with appropriate treatments."
糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）为糖尿病常见慢性并发症，可导致足部溃疡、坏疽，严重者可导致截肢，影响患者生活质量。DPN属中医“痹病”“痿病”等范畴，主要病机为气血阴阳亏虚，痰浊瘀血痹阻脉络，临床以气虚血瘀证多见。本文基于《黄帝内经》“气脉常通”理论，提出DPN气虚血瘀证患者的治疗应以“益气活血、化瘀通痹”为原则，使患者气脉通达，延缓疾病进展，为DPN的中医治疗提供参考。,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the common chronic complication of diabetes, which can lead to foot ulcers, gangrene, and amputation in severe cases, seriously affecting their quality of life. DPN belongs to the category of ""arthralgia"", ""hemorrhoids"" and other categories of TCM, and the main pathogenesis is the deficiency of qi and blood, yin and yang, and the obstruction of the meridians by phlegm and stasis. Clinically, DPN is more common with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome. Based on the theory of ""qi meridian constant communication"" in the Huang Di Nei Jing, this article proposed that for patients with DPN with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, the treatment should be based on the principle of ""invigorating qi and activating blood circulation, dissolving stasis and arthralgia"", so that the patients' qi meridian can be accessible, delay the disease progression, and provide reference for the TCM treatment of DPN."
代谢性疾病前状态是物质代谢紊乱且尚未达到疾病理化指标的机体状态，而糖代谢异常往往是代谢紊乱的关键环节。中医学中，脾的健运是精微物质生成与输布的基石，本文基于《内经》“五气之溢”理论，以脾备化失度为起点，对代谢性疾病前状态加以探讨，以期为临床代谢性疾病防治提供新的思路与方向。,"The pre-metabolic disease state is the body state of substance metabolism disorder that has not yet reached the physical and chemical indicators of the disease, and abnormal glucose metabolism is often the key link of metabolic disorder. In TCM, the healthy function of the spleen is the cornerstone of the production and distribution of fine substances. This article discussed the pre-metabolic disease state based on the theory of ""overflow of Five Qi"" in the Nei Jing, taking the loss of spleen preparedness as the starting point, in order to provide new ideas and directions for the prevention and treatment of clinical metabolic diseases."

The core pathogenesis is analyzed as disorder of qi and blood, mental damage, uncontrolled upward and downward movement, and pivot movement failure. The treatment method is to regulate qi and blood, invigorate qi and activate blood circulation and restore the rise and fall of visceral qi. Nourishing qi and promoting blood circulation should invigorate qi in the first. Appropriate blood activating drugs should be selected according to the degree of blood stasis, so that the blood circulation is smooth and the spirit has dependence. The key to restoring the normal balance of qi movement of visceral organs is to regulate not only liver ascending and lung descending but also spleen. Clinicians need pay attention to the nature of drug lifting and falling, conforming the physiological functions of the organs, to restore the rising and falling of the qi movement of internal organs."
雷公藤广泛应用于自身免疫系统疾病的治疗，但其明显的生殖毒性使其临床应用及推广受到限制。目前针对雷公藤的生殖损伤，尚未有明确的解决方案。中医认为，雷公藤的生殖毒性当责之于其辛苦寒凉之性，久用可燥肝血、伤肝阳、耗肾精、损肾阳，破坏脏腑的气血阴阳平衡，致不孕不育。本文根据肝肾与人体生殖功能的联系，提出从“乙癸同源”角度认识雷公藤的生殖毒性，并依据“肝肾同治”思想探索雷公藤生殖毒性的减毒之法，以期为临床安全应用拓展中医理论思考。,"Tripterygium wilfordii is widely used in the treatment of autoimmune system diseases, but its obvious reproductive toxicity limits the clinical application and promotion of the drug. At present, there is no clear solution to the reproductive injury of Tripterygium wilfordii. TCM believes that its reproductive toxicity lies in its properties of pungent, bitter, and cold. Long-term use can dry liver and blood, hurt liver and yang, consume kidney essence, damage kidney and yang, destroy the balance of qi and blood, yin and yang in the internal organs, and cause infertility. Based on the relationship between liver and kidney and human reproductive function, this article proposed to understand the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii from the perspective of ""Yi and Gui homology"", and explored the method of reducing the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii according to the thought of ""treating liver and kidney together"", in order to expand the theoretical thinking of TCM for the safe clinical application of this drug."

Methods　The clinical studies of TCM treatment for SAP in databases of CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP and SinoMed China Biomedical Literature Service System were retrieved from the establishment of the databases to February 28, 2022. The frequency statistic, clustering analysis and association rule analysis of TCM data were conducted using Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, SPSS Statistics 22.0 software, and core prescriptions were summarized. Results　 Totally 289 prescriptions were included, involving 185 kinds of Chinese materia medica, including 38 TCM syndrome types. Based on the overall study of SAP ""disease"", the clinical treatment of SAP was mainly based on the drugs for activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, tonifying deficiency and strengthening healthy qi, and regulating qi and resolving phlegm. The single Chinese materia medica with high frequency of use were Chuanxiaong Rhizoma, Salviea Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, etc. The commonly used drug pairs included Chuanxiaong Rhizoma-Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Chuanxiaong Rhizoma-Carthami Flos, Chuanxiaong Rhizoma-Aurantii Fructus Immaturus, etc. The drug complex network diagram and clustering analysis showed that the prescription of Buyang Huanwu Decoction was the basic prescription for the treatment of SAP; based on the specific research of SAP ""syndrome"", the most common TCM syndromes of SAP were qi deficiency and blood stasis, phlegm and blood stasis, and qi stagnation and blood stasis. The drug properties of the three drugs were mainly warm and mild; the tastes were mainly sweet, pungent and bitter, and most of them belong to the liver, spleen, lung and heart meridian; in terms of specific medication, the basic prescription of qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome was Buyang Huanwu Decoction, which was composed of high-frequency drugs such as Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Chuanxiaong Rhizoma, Salviea Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, etc; The phlegm and blood stasis syndrome was often based on the Gualou Xiebai Banxia Decoction and Taohong Siwu Decoction, which were composed of high frequency drugs such as Pinelliae Rhizoma, Chuanxiaong Rhizoma, Allii Macrostemonis Bulbus, etc; the basic prescription of qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome was Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction, which was composed of high frequency drugs such as Chuanxiaong Rhizoma, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Aurantii Fructus. Drug clustering analysis showed that both qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome were divided into 3 categories, and phlegm and blood stasis syndrome were divided into 4 categories. Conclusions　Deficiency, blood stasis, phlegm and stagnation are important pathological factors of SAP, in which qi deficiency is the basis of SAP, blood stasis runs through the disease, or both phlegm and qi stagnation. Focusing on the pathogenesis of deficiency in root and excess in superficiality, drugs with the efficacy of tonifying the deficiency and promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis are used in clinical treatment, according to different syndrome differentiation of prescription selection."

中风软瘫以中风后患者身体运动功能异常，肌肉张力下降为主要表现，是中风后较为常见的病理状态，软瘫时间越长预后越差。中医理论认为，中风主因“虚、风、火、痰、瘀、气”而发病，当邪气搏结、阻于经络则使气血凝滞、经筋损伤、肌肉痿废，导致中风软瘫，因此需立以通经柔筋为其主要治法。火针治疗中风软瘫具有通经温阳、柔筋止痛的作用，可温阳散寒、充养经脉经气、松解筋脉结节、推动气血运行、濡养四肢百骸。火针疗法可促进神经通路的恢复，加强局部新陈代谢，改善局部肌张力，从而恢复肢体功能。火针治疗中风后软瘫的高质量临床研究、选穴规律、规范化操作手法等有待进一步深化。,"Stroke flaccid paralysis is stroke patients with abnormal physical movement function and muscle tone decline as the main performance and is a kind of common pathological state after apoplectic stroke. The longer the flaccid paralysis is, the worse the prognosis. The theory of TCM holds that stroke is mainly due to ""deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, stasis, qi"", and when the pathogenic factor accumulate and block the meridians, which would cause blood stagnation, muscle and tendon damage and flaccidity, resulting in stroke paralysis. Therefore, it is necessary to set up the ""Tongjing Roujin"" (stimulating the muscle and nourishing the tendon) as its main treatment. Fire-needling has the effect of stimulating muscle, warming yang, nourishing tendon, and relieving pain in the treatment of stroke flaccid paralysis. It can warm yang and dissipate cold, replenish and nourish meridian qi, release muscle nodules, promote the circulation of qi and blood, and nourish all limbs and bones. Fire-needling therapy can promote the recovery of neural pathway, strengthen local metabolism, improve local muscle tension, and thus restore limb function. The high-quality clinical research, acupoint selection rules, and standardized operating techniques of fire-needling treatment for stroke flaccid paralysis need to be further deepened."

防风通圣散具有外散风热、内泻热结功效。回归刘完素学术思想本源，可知防风通圣散应以治风为标，治热为本，标本同治，表里双解，当为火热偏盛、内外俱实的病证而设。近年来，国内对本方的基础与临床研究方向主要有皮肤病、内分泌代谢疾病、消化系统疾病、呼吸系统疾病等，而国外相关研究则集中于肥胖相关的代谢疾病。研究发现，防风通圣散具有抗过敏、调节免疫、改善代谢紊乱等作用。目前，国内防风通圣散基础研究相对不足，对本方的机制探讨还需更加深入，且需开展更多大样本、高质量RCT。,"Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder has the effect of dispersing wind heat and internal purging heat. Returning to the origin of Liu Wansu's academic thought, it can be concluded that Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder should be based on the treatment of wind as the symptoms, the treatment of heat as the root, the treatment of both the symptoms and the root, and the double solution of the exterior and the interior. It should be set up for the syndrome of excessive heat and internal and external excess. In recent years, the basic and clinical research directions of this prescription in China mainly include skin diseases, endocrine and metabolic diseases, digestive system diseases, respiratory diseases, etc., while foreign related research focuses on obesity-related metabolic diseases. Studies have found that Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder has the effects of anti-allergy, regulating immunity and improving metabolic disorders.

Starting from the essence of the dual-heart disorder, the core treatment method is ""regulating Qi and blood together, ascending the clear and descending the turbid"". Among them, the regulation of Qi and blood should be treated differently according to deficiency and excess. If deficiency is the main issue, the combination of body and use should be used to regulate and supplement Qi and blood, and the commonly used prescription is Shuanghe Powder. If excess is the main issue, a combination of movement and stillness should be used to unblock the blood vessels, and commonly used prescriptions are Astragalus and Red Wind Soup, and Yueju Pill. Ascending the clear and descending the turbid should focus on regulating the Qi mechanism and appropriate supplementation and purgation, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate Qi and relieve depression, Buzhong Yiqi Tang to supplement Qi and ascend the clear, and Zhishi Tang and Zhishi Pill to eliminate the turbid and expel the dirt."

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。,"By systematically examining Longdan Xiegan Decoction in medical books of the past dynasties, it was found that the Longdan Xiegan Decoction recorded in Lan Shi Mi Cang mainly targeted men's genital odor at first. After Xue Ji's addition and subtraction, the scope of the prescription was gradually generalized and expanded, and confusion its name, composition and source of the prescription appeared, which was particularly prominent in Jingyue Quanshu and Yifang Jijie. Doctors used to interpret this prescription from the perspective of viscera. In order to better understand the main treatment rules of Longdan Xiegan Decoction, it is necessary to change the perspective and reinterpreted it from the perspective of meridians. Attributing the symptoms of the perineum to Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin, hypochondriac pain, deafness and other symptoms to the Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-Shaoyang, and adding or subtracting herbs according to the specific conditions, is not only conducive to a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the prescription to achieve accurate clinical syndrome differentiation and medication, but also prompts modern researchers to rethink the important role of meridian theory in the formation and development of the theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine."
《本草纲目》作为明代代表性本草著作，书中所附植物图像以另一种形式保留了李时珍对药材基原植物的考证结果，真实反映了明代对药物与植物的认识与利用情况。以书中木部香木类植物图像为例，通过考证图像所绘植物基原，以揭示明代对植物知识与药物性质的认识水平。木部香木类所载的 25 幅图像中，20 幅图像准确描述了植物的叶花及果实等，杉图对植物三尖杉形态细节的表述等均证明了明代对植物形态与药物性质认识处于较高水平。但乌药、阿魏等共 5 图的错误也说明明代对植物形态的认识仍有局限之处。通过图像考证结果与文字所载药性对比可知，明代对药性的了解程度已然鞭辟着里，对部分植物的药性认识甚至高于对其形态的了解。,"As a representative work of materia medica in the Ming Dynasty, the plant images attached to Compendium of Materia Medica retain the results of Li Shizhen's research on the original plants of medicinal materials in another form, which truly reflects the understanding and utilization of herbs in the Ming Dynasty.Taking the image of fragrant plants in Wood section in the book as an example, the original of the plants depicted in the images is examined to reveal the level of understanding of plant knowledge and medicinal properties in the Ming dynasty.Among the 25 images contained in the woody section, 20 images accurately depict the leaves, flowers and fruits of plants, and the description of the morphological details of the plant Cephalotaxus fortunei Hook. f. proves a high level of understanding of plant morphology and medicinal properties at the time.

By comparing the results of the image with the medicinal properties contained in the text,it is clear that the level of understanding of medicinal properties is very high in the Ming dynasty, and the understanding of the medicinal properties of some plants is even higher than the understanding of their morphology."
通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。,"By comparing the relevant unearthed and handed-down medical texts, we analyze the details of the Bian-Stone treatment in the Tianhui medical slips and verify the relationship with the theory of the handed-down medical texts. Compared with the Bian-Stone treatment in unearthed meridian literature the Mai Fa from Mawangdui and the Mai Shu from Zhangjiashan, if the method of ""Bian-Stone Spirit"" in Tianhui medical slips is used before the carbuncle gathers blood and pus forms,it can prevent the development of carbuncle and completely cure carbuncle.In addition, the diagnostic and therapeutic methods of ""Bian-Stone carbuncle"" may have inspired the later concepts of ""regulating the spirit"" and the preventative theory ""rescuing the sprout before it becomes an illness""."
