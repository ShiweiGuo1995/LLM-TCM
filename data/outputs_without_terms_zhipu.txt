日常生活中，我们常遇到一些健康问题，比如心情烦躁、失眠多梦，这时可以试试中医的“安神法”，帮助调理心神。而对于那些经常咳嗽、气喘的朋友，不妨采用“敛肺平喘”的方法来缓解症状。特别是遇到“血寒凝滞证”，身体容易感到冰冷、疼痛，需要温经散寒。男性朋友若不幸患上“子痈”，切勿忽视，及时采用“解毒散痈”的治疗方案。此外，“风痰阻络证”常表现为肢体麻木、活动不利，中医讲究“一动无有不动”，适当运动配合治疗，效果更佳。至于“骨痨”，虽较为罕见，但也要引起重视，及时就医。希望大家都能通过中医智慧，守护好自己的健康。||In daily life, we often encounter some health issues, such as irritability, insomnia, and excessive dreaming, at which time we can try the traditional Chinese medicine method of "calming the mind" to help regulate the spirit. For those who frequently suffer from coughing and asthma, the approach of "consolidating the lung and relieving asthma" can be used to alleviate symptoms. Especially when encountering the "blood cold stagnation syndrome," the body tends to feel cold and painful, requiring the warming of meridians and dispelling cold. If male friends unfortunately develop "testicular abscess," do not neglect it and promptly adopt the treatment plan of "detoxifying and dispersing abscesses." Additionally, the "wind-phlegm blocking collaterals syndrome" often manifests as limb numbness and difficulty in movement; traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "one movement leads to all movements," so appropriate exercise combined with treatment yields better results. As for "bone tuberculosis," although it is relatively rare, it should also be taken seriously and treated promptly. It is hoped that everyone can safeguard their health through the wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine.

顿咳与肺痈在中医理论中均为肺系疾病，二者虽病因病机各异，但均与中焦运化失职相关。肺为气之主，中焦为气血生化之源，若中焦失调，则津能载气功能受阻，导致肺气郁闭，发为顿咳；若痰湿内生，久蕴化热，痰热互结，则可形成肺痈。此外，寒性凝滞易致痰凝胞宫证，影响冲任二脉，进而引发遗尿、颤症等症。由此可见，中焦功能失调在肺系疾病及妇科杂病的发病中具有重要作用，临证时应注重调畅中焦，以恢复津能载气之职。||Whooping cough and lung abscess are both lung-related diseases in traditional Chinese medicine theory. Although their causes and pathogeneses differ, they are both related to the dysfunction of the middle jiao (spleen and stomach). The lung is the master of qi, and the middle jiao is the source of qi and blood production. If the middle jiao is out of balance, the function of body fluids to carry qi is impeded, leading to the stagnation of lung qi and the onset of whooping cough. If phlegm-dampness is internally generated and accumulates over time to transform into heat, with phlegm and heat intermingling, it can result in a lung abscess. Additionally, cold nature tends to cause stagnation, easily leading to phlegm coagulation in the uterus, affecting the thoroughfare and conception vessels, and thereby causing symptoms such as enuresis and tremor. It can be seen that the dysfunction of the middle jiao plays a significant role in the onset of lung-related diseases and various gynecological disorders. In clinical practice, attention should be paid to regulating and smoothing the middle jiao to restore the function of body fluids carrying qi.

在探讨中医证候时，喉咳与疰夏常被视为季节性疾病的典型表现。喉咳多因肺气不宣，而疰夏则源于暑湿困脾，脾主肌肉功能失调。进一步分析，骨痨患者常伴有血瘀之象，病势缠绵。舌诊中，白黏苔的出现提示痰湿内阻，与阴黄病、萎黄病的病机密切相关。阴黄病多因寒湿内蕴，而萎黄病则多由脾胃虚弱、气血生化不足所致。综合上述病证，可知脏腑功能失调、气血瘀滞是致病关键，治疗时应注重调和脾胃、活血化瘀。||In discussing TCM syndromes, throat cough and summer heat stroke are often regarded as typical manifestations of seasonal diseases. Throat cough is mostly due to the failure of lung qi to disperse, while summer heat stroke originates from dampness and heat disturbing the spleen, leading to dysfunction of the spleen's role in governing muscles. Further analysis shows that patients with bone tuberculosis often present signs of blood stasis, with a lingering disease course. In tongue diagnosis, the appearance of white sticky fur indicates internal obstruction of phlegm-dampness, closely related to the pathogenesis of yin jaundice and wasting jaundice. Yin jaundice is mostly caused by internal accumulation of cold-dampness, while wasting jaundice is often due to weakness of the spleen and stomach, and insufficient generation and transformation of qi and blood. Synthesizing the above syndromes, it is evident that dysfunction of zang-fu organs and stagnation of qi and blood are key factors in pathogenesis, and treatment should focus on harmonizing the spleen and stomach, and promoting blood circulation to remove stasis.

在探讨冻疮与肺风痰喘的病机时，须重视脏腑之气失调所致的病理变化。牢脉多见于脾胀患者，而枯舌则提示阴液亏损，风燥袭表证常引发皮肤干燥皲裂。急惊风患儿多因外邪侵袭，导致肝风内动，进而影响肺脾功能。综合分析，脏腑之气失衡是上述病症的共同病机，调理脏腑、恢复气机平衡为治疗关键。||In discussing the pathogenesis of chilblains and pulmonary wind-phlegm asthma, attention must be paid to the pathological changes caused by the imbalance of visceral qi. Firm pulse is often seen in patients with spleen distension, while a withered tongue indicates the depletion of yin fluid. The syndrome of wind-dryness attacking the exterior often leads to dry and cracked skin. Children with acute convulsion are usually affected by external pathogens, causing internal stirring of liver wind, which in turn affects the functions of the lung and spleen. A comprehensive analysis shows that the imbalance of visceral qi is the common pathogenesis of the aforementioned diseases, and regulating the viscera and restoring the balance of qi is the key to treatment.

在探讨中医理论时，藏象学说揭示了脏腑功能与外在表现的联系。针对小儿痄腮，中医认为其病机常与暑性炎热相关，表现为发热、腮部肿胀。若病情迁延，可致肾气不固证，表现为气不摄血，易见皮肤紫癜。治疗上，可根据“发表攻里”原则，采用温下实寒之法，以调和内外。若见角弓反张，提示病情严重，需及时辨证施治，以防邪气深入。通过综合调理，方能恢复机体阴阳平衡。||In exploring Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, the Zang-Fu theory reveals the connection between organ functions and external manifestations. For pediatric mumps, TCM believes that the pathogenesis is often related to the heat of summer, manifested as fever and swelling of the parotid glands. If the condition persists, it can lead to a syndrome of kidney qi deficiency, characterized by failure of qi to control blood, often seen as skin purpura. In treatment, according to the principle of "expelling superficial pathogens and attacking internal ones," the method of warming and dispersing internal cold can be adopted to harmonize the internal and external. If there is opisthotonos, it indicates a severe condition, requiring timely syndrome differentiation and treatment to prevent the invasion of pathogenic factors. Only through comprehensive regulation can the balance of yin and yang in the body be restored.

This syndrome often arises from irregular diet, leading to the intermingling of phlegm and food, which in turn affects the functions of the liver and stomach, resulting in a deficiency-cold syndrome of the liver and stomach. In treatment, the method of purging fire and relieving constipation can help expel phlegm and food, restoring the spleen and stomach's transportation and transformation functions. For the syndrome of blood stasis obstructing the lung collaterals, it is advisable to combine cough-relieving and asthma-calming herbs to disperse phlegm, ventilate the lungs, unblock collaterals, and dissipate blood stasis. Additionally, although centipede bites are external factors, they also require syndrome differentiation and treatment to prevent pathogenic qi from invading internally and affecting the recovery of vital energy.

Gastric cold and fluid retention syndrome and large intestine fluid deficiency syndrome are both caused by an imbalance of yin and yang in the body; the former requires warming the middle and dispelling cold, while the latter should moisten the intestines and promote bowel movements. Regulating the Chong and Ren meridians is crucial for treating women's diseases, especially during the period of heavenly correspondence, when harmony should be emphasized. The syndrome of fire disturbing the heart spirit needs to be cleared and calmed, while the method of astringing the lung and stopping cough is suitable for cough and asthma due to unconsolidated lung qi. Although the syndromes differ, they all adhere to the principles of yin-yang and the five elements. Detailed differentiation and treatment are essential in clinical practice to achieve effectiveness.

Further observation reveals that some patients develop internal phlegm-dampness due to excessive leisure, leading to phlegm turbidity obstructing the collaterals, which affects the flow of qi and blood. Additionally, patients with erysipelas may also exhibit heart blood deficiency syndrome, whose pathogenesis is closely related to insufficient water wheel and hyperactive heart fire. It is worth noting that although the condition of exposed crotch is rare, its association with heart blood deficiency syndrome should not be overlooked, as there is mutual influence in their pathogenesis. Based on the above analysis, the syndrome differentiation and treatment of heart blood deficiency syndrome require a comprehensive consideration of various relevant factors to achieve precise treatment.

在中医理论中，太阳人常表现为阳气旺盛，而酒剂作为传统剂型，能助阳行气。观察舌形可辨胃阴虚证，舌质红绛提示阴液亏损。阴癣与胆疸虽病位不同，但均属里病出表之象，反映了邪气由内向外透发的病理过程。血海充盈则气血调和，反之则诸病丛生。通过辨证施治，调和阴阳，方能达到标本兼治的效果。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, people with excessive yang often exhibit strong yang energy, and alcoholic preparations, as a traditional dosage form, can help promote yang and circulate qi. Observing the tongue shape can identify stomach yin deficiency syndrome, where a red and crimson tongue indicates a loss of yin fluid. Although tinea versicolor and gallbladder jaundice differ in their locations, both manifest as internal diseases presenting externally, reflecting a pathological process where pathogenic factors penetrate from the inside out.

Such transformations are also common in pediatric epidemic febrile diseases, due to the delicate nature of children's yin and yang, making them susceptible to external pathogenic invasions. Enteritis, as an internal miscellaneous disease, often results from the accumulation of damp-heat, affecting the ascending and descending of vital energy, thereby causing discomfort symptoms. Although wind stroke and tendon bi have different causes, both involve disharmony of meridian qi and blood; the former is dominated by internal movement of wind, while the latter is caused by cold-damp obstructing the tendons and vessels. In summary, despite the diverse manifestations of various diseases, their internal pathogenic mechanisms share commonalities, warranting further in-depth investigation.

Pregnancy-related aphonia is associated with dysfunction of the "Yuan Fu," and can be regulated through the "brightening the eyes" liver-nourishing method. Additionally, some people experience "sweat spots," which indicate an excess of internal dampness, and attention should be given to regulation.

Toothache due to dental caries can also be treated with the method of pungent and warm to relieve the exterior, to warm and unblock the meridians and alleviate pain. The comprehensive application of the above treatment methods aims to harmonize yin and yang, restore the function of the viscera, and embodies the essence of syndrome differentiation and treatment in traditional Chinese medicine.

最近不少朋友反映脾胃不适，其实这可能是脾胃积热证的表现。中医讲究“水制”，平时多喝水能帮助调理。六郁也是常见问题，情绪不畅会导致气滞血瘀。严重时甚至可能引发噎膈病，吃饭都困难。爱喝酒的朋友要小心酒癖，长期酗酒伤身。调理时，建议药物分服，效果更佳。如果发现面青，可能是体内寒气过重，需及时调理。🗎霍乱虽不常见，但也要警惕，保持饮食卫生很重要。希望大家都能注重日常养生，远离疾病困扰。||Recently, many friends have reported discomfort in the spleen and stomach, which may actually be a manifestation of spleen-stomach heat accumulation syndrome. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "water regulation," and drinking more water can help with conditioning. Six depressions are also common issues, and emotional stagnation can lead to qi stagnation and blood stasis. In severe cases, it may even trigger dysphagia, making it difficult to eat. Friends who enjoy drinking should be cautious about alcoholism, as long-term excessive drinking harms the body. During conditioning, it is recommended to take medications separately for better effectiveness. If facial paleness is observed, it may indicate an excessive coldness in the body, requiring timely adjustment. Although cholera is not common, it should also be guarded against, and maintaining dietary hygiene is very important. I hope everyone can pay attention to daily health preservation and stay away from the困扰 of diseases.

夏季易发暑淫证，属时令病范畴，常表现为心肝实热证，症见腰痛、气短。中医认为肺主气，气随血脱则体弱，需扶正祛邪，调和血海，以恢复气血平衡。此时，宜选用清暑益气、养血安神之方，既解暑热，又固本培元，从而达到标本兼治之目的。日常调护亦不可忽视，宜避暑降温，饮食清淡，以助康复。||Summer is prone to the occurrence of summer heat syndrome, which falls under the category of seasonal diseases, often manifesting as heart and liver excess heat syndrome, with symptoms such as low back pain and shortness of breath. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the lung governs qi, and when qi is lost with blood, the body becomes weak, necessitating the reinforcement of the body's vital functions and the elimination of pathogenic factors, as well as the harmonization of the blood sea to restore the balance of qi and blood. At this time, it is advisable to use formulas that clear summer heat, replenish qi, nourish blood, and calm the spirit, which not only relieve summer heat but also strengthen the body's foundation, thereby achieving the goal of treating both the symptoms and the root cause. Daily care should not be neglected, including avoiding heat and keeping cool, maintaining a light diet, to aid in recovery.

Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes the mutual restraint of the five elements; at this time, one should clear heat and relieve restlessness, and harmonize yin and yang. I recommend a heat-clearing and phlegm-resolving formula, especially suitable for those with heat toxin invading the nutritive level syndrome. The fiery nature tends to cause excessive internal fire, so consolidating the meridians and stopping bleeding is also an important aspect of summer regulation. Usually, drink more water, avoid staying up late, and combine with Chinese herbal medicine adjustments to safely get through the summer!

在探讨肾虚水泛证的病机时，需重视其与妊娠消渴的关联性，二者均涉及脏腑功能失调。足底疔虽为外科疾患，但其成因亦不离内虚，滋补心肺之法可资借鉴。小儿乳蛾之治，宜遵循“虚者补其母”原则，调和脾胃以固根本。圆癣虽属皮肤病，然其湿热内蕴之理与上述诸证相通。至于祛瘀下胎，乃针对妊娠期特定病理之应急措施，须审慎用药，以防伤及母体。综合诸证，中医辨证论治之精妙可见一斑。||In exploring the pathogenesis of kidney deficiency and water overflow syndrome, attention should be paid to its correlation with gestational diabetes, as both involve dysfunction of internal organs. Although foot furuncle is a surgical condition, its cause is also inseparable from internal deficiency, and the method of nourishing the heart and lungs can be used for reference. The treatment of pediatric tonsillitis should follow the principle of "nourishing the mother for deficiency," harmonizing the spleen and stomach to strengthen the foundation. Round tinea, though a skin disease, shares the same principle of internal dampness and heat as the aforementioned syndromes. As for removing blood stasis and inducing labor, it is an emergency measure for specific pathological conditions during pregnancy, and medication must be cautious to prevent harm to the mother. Combining these syndromes, the subtlety of syndrome differentiation and treatment in traditional Chinese medicine is evident.

颤动舌作为中医诊断中的重要体征，常提示经络现象异常，需引起重视。温里剂在治疗肺肾阳虚证中具有显著疗效，能够温补阳气，改善鼓胀症状。🗎热痢患者常伴有乳漏现象，此时需辨证施治，调和气血。血瘤作为一种难治性疾病，其治疗亦需结合经络调理，综合施治。通过中医的整体观念和辨证论治，可以有效缓解上述病症，提升患者生活质量。||Trembling tongue is an important sign in traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis, often indicating abnormal meridian phenomena, which requires attention. Warm interior formulas have significant efficacy in treating lung and kidney yang deficiency syndromes, able to warm and replenish yang energy, and improve symptoms of tympanites. Patients with heat dysentery often experience galactorrhea, at which time syndrome differentiation and treatment should be applied to harmonize qi and blood.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友出现了胃气上逆证，吃饭后总觉得胃里不舒服，甚至有呕吐感。其实，中医讲究因人制宜，每个人的体质不同，调理方法也各异。比如，有些人容易感受风寒🗎痹，导致关节疼痛；而有些人则可能因阴竭阳脱，出现四肢冰凉、大汗淋漓的症状。穿骨流注更是让人痛苦不堪，需要及时调理。在饮食上，我们要注意四气五味的搭配，尤其是脾主四肢，脾胃健康才能四肢有力。对于胃气上逆证，可以适当使用苦寒攻下的方法，但一定要在专业中医师的指导下进行，切勿自行用药。希望大家都能根据自身情况，合理调理，保持健康！||Recently, the weather has turned cooler, and many friends have experienced symptoms of stomach qi ascending counterflow, feeling uncomfortable in the stomach after eating, and even having a sense of nausea. In fact, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes individualized treatment, as each person's constitution is different, and the methods of regulation vary. For example, some people are prone to feeling the chill of wind and cold, leading to joint pain; while others may experience symptoms such as cold limbs and profuse sweating due to yin exhaustion and yang collapse. Bone-penetrating flow is particularly distressing and requires timely regulation. In terms of diet, we should pay attention to the combination of the four qi and five flavors, especially since the spleen governs the limbs, and only with a healthy spleen and stomach can the limbs be strong. For stomach qi ascending counterflow, methods of bitter and cold purgation can be appropriately used, but this must be done under the guidance of a professional Chinese medicine practitioner, and one should never self-medicate. I hope everyone can reasonably regulate their health based on their own circumstances and maintain well-being!

If the spleen loses its healthy transportation function, the syndrome of phlegm-dampness accumulating in the spleen ensues, affecting the normal distribution of essence and turbidity. Intestinal wind injuring the collaterals syndrome is commonly seen in hematochezia, and the treatment should aim to cool the blood and stop bleeding. Additionally, the stepping and rocking method, as a unique massage technique, can harmonize qi and blood, and alleviate symptoms of limb flaccidity. For excess syndromes, the method of detoxifying and resolving abscesses is suitable for the initial stage of carbuncles and ulcers, focusing on clearing heat, detoxifying, reducing swelling, and dispersing nodules. The comprehensive application of the aforementioned theories and therapies can effectively regulate the functions of the internal organs and restore the balance of yin and yang.

If the facial color is dim, it often indicates qi stagnation and blockage syndrome, which requires the use of the penetrating cool technique for regulation. Observing from eight directions can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the condition. The appearance of snail blisters is mostly due to the internal accumulation of dampness, which needs to be combined with the point method to dredge the meridians. Anger harms the liver, and emotional fluctuations easily lead to liver qi stagnation, at which time it is advisable to use nourishing and calming agents to soothe the liver and calm the mind. By comprehensively applying these theories and techniques of traditional Chinese medicine, one can effectively regulate the body and mind and restore health.

At this time, the phenomenon of knotted pulse should not be overlooked, indicating stagnation of qi and blood within the body. For such conditions, fire needle therapy can activate blood and resolve stasis, harmonizing qi and blood.

最近不少朋友反映孩子容易感冒，其实这和“肺开窍于鼻”有关，肺气不足，鼻子自然容易受寒。有些孩子天生体质较弱，可能是“胎传”所致。家长们要注意，孩子如果出现“乳蛾”或“癞头疮”，可能是体内“后天之气”不足，需要及时调整。此外，如果孩子感觉“身重”，可能是因为“大肠液亏证”，导致体内阴阳失衡。平时多注意饮食调理，适当运动，才能有效“调整阴阳”，让孩子远离疾病困扰。||Recently, many friends have reported that their children are prone to colds, which is actually related to the concept that "the lung opens into the nose." When lung qi is insufficient, the nose is naturally more susceptible to cold. Some children are inherently weaker in constitution, possibly due to "congenital transmission." Parents should pay attention: if children exhibit symptoms like "tonsillitis" or "scrofula," it might indicate a deficiency of "acquired qi" in their bodies, necessitating timely adjustments. Additionally, if a child feels "body heaviness," it could be due to "large intestine fluid deficiency syndrome," leading to an imbalance of yin and yang in the body. Usually, paying more attention to dietary regulation and engaging in moderate exercise can effectively "adjust yin and yang," keeping children free from the困扰 of diseases.

在探讨脾虚蕴证与纳少关系时，需兼顾三阴三阳之辨证体系。脾虚日久，运化失职，致纳少，进而影响气血生化，形成弱脉。若外感风寒痹，易引发风水相搏证，加剧病情。奔豚之症亦与脾虚相关，气机逆乱，循经上冲。此外，疣目虽为皮肤病变，然其成因亦不离脾虚蕴湿，内外合邪所致。故治疗时应综合考虑，健脾益气，祛风散寒，调和三阴三阳，方能标本兼治。||In exploring the relationship between spleen deficiency and poor appetite, it is necessary to consider the syndrome differentiation system of the three yin and three yang. Prolonged spleen deficiency leads to dysfunction in transportation and transformation, resulting in poor appetite, which in turn affects the generation and transformation of qi and blood, forming a weak pulse. If externally affected by wind-cold bi, it can easily trigger the syndrome of wind and water struggling, exacerbating the condition. The symptoms of running piglets are also related to spleen deficiency, with qi mechanism disorder and upward rush along the meridians. Additionally, although warts are skin lesions, their cause is also inseparable from spleen deficiency and dampness accumulation, resulting from the combination of internal and external evils. Therefore, in treatment, a comprehensive approach should be taken to strengthen the spleen and replenish qi, dispel wind and scatter cold, and harmonize the three yin and three yang, in order to address both the root and the symptoms.

Long-term irregular diet can easily lead to "food stagnation," affecting digestion and absorption. The dredging of the "Hand Yangming Large Intestine Meridian" is greatly beneficial in alleviating such issues. If one feels chest tightness and rib pain, it might be a manifestation of "blood stasis obstructing the chest and hypochondrium syndrome," requiring timely regulation. In dry weather, one is susceptible to "dryness toxin syndrome," characterized by dry skin, throat discomfort, and even triggering "throat wind." Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes syndrome differentiation and treatment, and for different "syndromes," regulating the "upper jiao" is particularly important. In daily life, paying more attention to bodily changes and adjusting nourishment reasonably is essential for health and longevity.

The liver prefers smoothness and dislikes depression, and emotional fluctuations such as anger overcoming thought can exacerbate the condition, affecting the smooth flow of Qi. In treatment, emphasis is placed on detoxification and reducing swelling, harmonizing the liver and spleen, to restore the normal skin color at the junction of red and white flesh. The phenomenon of spontaneous sweating also needs attention, as it indicates the insecurity of defensive Qi, requiring methods to consolidate the exterior and stop sweating. Comprehensive regulation is essential to treat both the root and the symptoms.

Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the syndrome of the Taiyin Spleen Meridian and the excess syndrome of the Yangming Fu organ can also lead to similar discomfort. It is recommended to try the warming meridian and dispelling cold formula, which can effectively alleviate the invasion of cold pathogens. Additionally, clearing and purging gallbladder heat is also a good option, especially for those with excessive liver and gallbladder fire.

Spleen yang deficiency with water retention often manifests as irregular stool consistency, being sometimes dry and sometimes loose. Although cat's eye sore is a skin disease, its etiology is closely related to the syndrome of phlegm and qi binding internally. In treating such conditions, it is advisable to use methods that nourish yin and benefit the stomach, supplemented with qi-tonifying herbs to enhance the function of the spleen and stomach.

For example, various symptoms that appear before and after menstruation are often related to Liver Meridian Wind-Heat. Some people may also experience conditions like "ox gait," making it difficult to walk smoothly. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes the concepts of "mutual aversion" and "yang cannot grow alone"; when there is an imbalance of yin and yang in the body, problems arise.

If "kidney failing to grasp qi syndrome" occurs, kidney qi needs to be regulated to restore its function of grasping qi. Additionally, "passenger transport" reflects the influence of the natural world on the human body, and "overthinking injuring the spleen" reminds us that emotional factors cannot be overlooked in their impact on the spleen and stomach. For superficial deficiency with spontaneous sweating, "formula for securing the exterior and stopping sweating" can effectively regulate the condition. In syndrome differentiation and treatment, "wei qi ying blood syndrome categories" is an important classification method, while "the monarch organ" refers to the heart, emphasizing its dominant role among the viscera. Comprehensive regulation is essential to achieve yin-yang balance, health, and longevity.

在日常养生中，我们常提到“肺其华在毛”，意指肺气充足则毛发润泽。若肺气不足，可适当选用“升浮药”来调理。而对于“消渴类病”，中医认为与“足厥阴肝经证”密切相关，需从肝经入手调理。此外，情志不畅也是致病因素，此时可尝试“情志相胜法”来调节情绪。在自我检查时，不妨关注“虚里”的跳动情况，以判断心气盛衰。有趣的是，有些人会出现“斜飞脉”，这是脉象的一种特殊表现。眼睛不适，警惕“聚星障”，及时调理以免影响视力。中医智慧，融入生活，健康自然来。||In daily health maintenance, we often mention that "the lung's vitality is reflected in the hair," meaning that sufficient lung qi results in lustrous hair. If lung qi is deficient, appropriate "ascending and floating herbs" can be used for regulation. For "diabetes-like diseases," traditional Chinese medicine believes they are closely related to the "Liver Meridian of Foot Jueyin syndrome," and should be addressed by regulating the liver meridian. Additionally, emotional disharmony is also a causative factor, and in such cases, the "method of emotional balance" can be tried to regulate emotions. During self-examination, it is advisable to pay attention to the pulsation of the "Xuli" area to assess the strength of heart qi.

在现代快节奏的生活中，很多人容易出现偏头风，这其实与温补肝阳不足有关。中医认为，营气是维持身体正常运转的重要物质，一旦营气不足，容易引发各种疾病。比如，肾经寒🗎证就是因寒邪侵袭肾经所致，表现为腰膝冷痛。而瘴疟则多见于南方潮湿地区，需特别注意。遇到惊则气乱的情况，情绪波动大会影响气血运行。对于药毒类病，我们要谨慎用药，避免药物副作用。燔针疗法在某些情况下也能起到很好的温经散寒作用。总之，了解这些中医术语，有助于我们更好地调理身体，保持健康。||In the fast-paced modern life, many people are prone to migraines, which are actually related to the deficiency of warming and tonifying the liver yang. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that nutrient qi is an important substance for maintaining the normal functioning of the body, and once there is a deficiency of nutrient qi, it can easily lead to various diseases. For example, cold syndrome of the kidney meridian is caused by the invasion of cold pathogens into the kidney meridian, manifested as cold pain in the waist and knees. Malaria is more common in the humid southern regions and requires special attention. In situations where sudden fright causes qi disorder, significant emotional fluctuations can affect the flow of qi and blood.

Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the spleen and stomach are the foundation of acquired constitution and the source of genuine qi; once there is deficiency heat in the spleen and stomach, with the spleen being as weak as a ball, the body will issue warnings. Normally, one should pay attention to the harmony of the five flavors in diet, especially when the large intestine's function of transmission is poor, a lighter diet should be adopted. If both the defensive and nutritive aspects are affected, leading to a decline in the body's resistance, it might be beneficial to try yin-tonifying agents to nourish yin and body fluids, harmonize the spleen and stomach, and restore genuine qi.

When facing difficult and complex conditions such as pica, TCM often employs methods to kill parasites and eliminate accumulations, administering treatments in the form of thread-like agents, which are convenient and effective. Latent pathogens hidden within the body require the use of thunderfire divine needles to expel, in order to restore vital energy. When external pathogens invade, comprehensive regulation is necessary to address both the symptoms and the root causes.
