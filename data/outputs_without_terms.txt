女性宫颈癌的发生与高危型人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染关系密切，及时有效地阻断高危型 HPV 感染对预防宫颈癌的发生有重要意义。黄元御的“一气周流”理论思想崇尚中土，注重整体气机的调畅，可阐释女性的生理病理。而高危型 HPV 感染的发生与中焦脾土失运，气机周流不畅，机体抗邪能力低下致清浊升降失常有关。基于“一气周流”理论结合“治未病”思想，笔者提出“未病先防，调畅中土存正气”“既病防变，升降相因祛毒邪”“瘥后防复，阴阳平衡和气血”的高危型 HPV 感染的防治原则，以期为临床治疗提供参考。||The occurrence of cervical cancer in women is closely related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; timely and effective interruption of high-risk HPV infection is of great significance for the prevention of cervical cancer. Huang Yuanyu's "one qi circulation" theory emphasizes the central earth, focusing on the smooth flow of overall qi, which can explain the physiology and pathology of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is associated with the dysfunction of spleen transportation in the middle energizer, the unsmooth circulation of qi, and the decline in the body's ability to resist evil, leading to abnormal rise and fall of clarity and turbidity. Based on the "one qi circulation" theory combined with the "treatment before disease" concept, the author proposes the prevention and treatment principles for high-risk HPV infection: "preventing disease before it occurs by regulating the middle earth to maintain righteous qi," "preventing disease progression by using mutual cause and effect of rising and falling to eliminate toxic pathogens," and "preventing recurrence after recovery by maintaining the balance of yin and yang and harmonizing qi and blood." This is expected to provide reference for clinical treatment.

“四位一体”是基于“性、位、势、证”四维角度的研究思路，有助于多维度、立体化地辨识分析经方。慢性心力衰竭（CHF）病机为心气心阳亏虚、三焦气化失司日久，后期由虚向实进展可见虚实夹杂。茯苓桂枝白术甘草汤（简称“苓桂术甘汤”）通过“性、位、势、证”四位发挥作用：方性为辛甘而温，淡甘兼苦，辛甘温以化气利水、扶阳涤饮，淡苦以渗水燥湿、通利水道；方位为心、脾、三焦，可鼓舞心阳、健脾蠲饮、通调三焦水道；方势为上下并行、内外兼修、通上利下、宣外补内，则三焦水道借势通达；方证为心阳亏虚、水饮泛滥痰饮证，治疗水气上冲性心脏病应用为多。三焦失司与 CHF 反复发作互为因果，苓桂术甘汤可暖三焦气化之火、通三焦气化之道，针对 CHF 的全身性水液潴留发挥作用；其药理作用有抗炎、抗血小板聚集、调节心肌细胞膜离子通道、抗缺血再灌注损伤、调控血管舒缩等。从“四位一体”的角度解构苓桂术甘汤，并结合“三焦气化”理论探讨苓桂术甘汤治疗 CHF 机制，对重新焕发经方生命力及精准有效应用经方具有重要意义。||The "four-in-one" approach, based on the four dimensions of "nature, position, momentum, and evidence," provides a research perspective that facilitates multidimensional and stereoscopic identification and analysis of Kampo formulas. For chronic heart failure (CHF), the pathogenesis is characterized by deficiency of heart qi and heart yang, long-term dysfunction of qi transformation in the triple energizer, and later progression from deficiency to excess, showing a mixed pattern of deficiency and excess. The Poriae Cocos, Ramulus Cinnamomi, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae, and Radix Glycyrrhizae Decoction (referred to as "Linggui Zhugan Decoction") exerts its effects through the "four-in-one" approach: the nature of the formula is pungent-sweet and warm, with a bland-sweet and slightly bitter taste, pungent-sweet warmth transforms qi and promotes diuresis, supports yang and eliminates phlegm-dampness, while the bland-bitter taste promotes diuresis and dries dampness, and facilitates water pathways; the position of the formula involves the heart, spleen, and triple energizer, invigorating heart yang, strengthening the spleen to eliminate phlegm-dampness, and regulating the water pathways of the triple energizer; the momentum of the formula operates both vertically and horizontally, internally and externally, promoting upward clearance and downward diuresis, and externally clearing and internally replenishing, thereby facilitating the water pathways of the triple energizer; the evidence of the formula is deficiency of heart yang and flooding of phlegm-dampness, commonly used in treating heart diseases caused by upward rushing water qi. Dysfunction of the triple energizer and recurrent episodes of CHF are causally interrelated. Linggui Zhugan Decoction can warm the fire of qi transformation in the triple energizer and facilitate the channels of qi transformation in the triple energizer, playing a role in addressing systemic fluid retention in CHF; its pharmacological actions include anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of myocardial cell membrane ion channels, anti-ischemia reperfusion injury, and regulation of vascular tone. Deconstructing Linggui Zhugan Decoction from the perspective of the "four-in-one" and combining it with the theory of qi transformation in the triple energizer to discuss its mechanism for treating CHF is of significant importance for revitalizing the vitality of classical formulas and their precise and effective application.

The method involves screening ancient prescriptions for treating pediatric epilepsy from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula Database of the Institute of Information Science of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Excel 2013 was used to conduct frequency analysis on the TCMs and their properties, flavors, and meridians in the included prescriptions; R 3.6.3's arules package was adopted based on the Apriori algorithm for association analysis; the sankey package and ggraph package of R 3.6.3 were used to draw networks of the properties, flavors, and meridians of frequently used TCMs and their associated rules, achieving data visualization. A total of 360 prescriptions were included, with pills being the main dosage form; most prescriptions consisted of 1-10 types of TCMs, totaling 192 (53.33%, 192/360); a total of 152 types of TCMs were involved, with commonly used ones including licorice, musk, wind-barrier, gastrodia, and aconite. Frequently used medications (frequency ≥30) were mainly warm or neutral in nature; they were mainly pungent, bitter, and sweet in flavor; and mainly belonged to the spleen and liver meridians. Association analysis results showed that commonly used two-drug combinations included buffalo-bezoar-musk, ginseng-poria, and wind-barrier-licorice; commonly used three-drug combinations included gastrodia-aconite-silkworm-pupa, poria-licorice-ginseng, and musk-buffalo-bezoar-realgar. The conclusion is that ancient prescriptions for treating pediatric epilepsy mainly consist of drugs for calming the liver and suppressing wind, opening the orifices, and tonifying; the core combination strategy is mainly transforming phlegm and suppressing wind, warming meridians and promoting yang, opening the orifices and stopping spasms, clearing heat and resolving depression, and invigorating qi and harmonizing blood.

尿毒症瘙痒（UP）是终末期肾脏病患者常见并发症，严重降低患者生活质量。中医外治法治疗 UP 相较于中药内治法操作简便、起效迅速，且能避免口服药物所致首关效应及可能带来肝肾损伤，治疗手段主要包括中药外洗、药浴、熏洗、湿敷、灌肠、刮痧、针刺、耳穴贴压、穴位敷贴、穴位离子导入、自体血穴位注射等。目前，多数研究在西医常规治疗基础上加用中医外治法，可提高疗效，在改善瘙痒症状、炎症指标、睡眠质量及焦虑抑郁状态等方面具有一定优势；一些研究选取甲状旁腺激素、血磷、CRP、IL-6、组胺、SCr、BUN、β2-微球蛋白等指标评价疗效，结果提示中医外治法可改善患者微炎症状态，保护肾功能，但其作用机制有待进一步研究。现有研究存在以下问题：临床疗效评价量表不统一，难以横向比较和总结；瘙痒症状的缓解依据量表评判，主观性较强；研究疗程较短，无法评判远期疗效和安全性；部分研究未指明患者证型，难以体现中医辨证论治优势等，今后还需完善。||Uremic pruritus (UP) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, significantly reducing their quality of life. Compared to traditional Chinese medicine internal treatment, external treatment methods for UP are more convenient to operate, take effect quickly, and can avoid the first-pass effect caused by oral medication as well as potential liver and kidney damage. The main treatment methods include external washing with Chinese medicine, medicated baths, fumigation and washing, wet dressing, enema, Gua Sha, acupuncture, ear acupressure, acupoint application, iontophoresis, and autologous blood injection at acupoints. Currently, most studies add external treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine on the basis of conventional Western medical treatments, which can improve therapeutic effects and have certain advantages in improving itching symptoms, inflammatory indicators, sleep quality, and anxiety-depression status; some studies use indicators such as parathyroid hormone, serum phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, β2-microglobulin, etc., to evaluate efficacy, suggesting that external treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine can improve the micro-inflammatory state of patients and protect renal function, but their mechanisms need further study. Existing research has the following issues: inconsistency in clinical efficacy evaluation scales makes it difficult to compare and summarize results horizontally; relief of itching symptoms relies heavily on rating scales, making the evaluation more subjective; short study durations make it impossible to assess long-term efficacy and safety; some studies do not specify patient syndrome types, making it difficult to demonstrate the advantages of syndrome differentiation and treatment in traditional Chinese medicine, among other issues; future research needs to be improved.

糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）为糖尿病常见慢性并发症，可导致足部溃疡、坏疽，严重者可导致截肢，影响患者生活质量。DPN属中医“痹病”“痿病”等范畴，主要病机为气血阴阳亏虚，痰浊瘀血痹阻脉络，临床以气虚血瘀证多见。本文基于《黄帝内经》“气脉常通”理论，提出DPN气虚血瘀证患者的治疗应以“益气活血、化瘀通痹”为原则，使患者气脉通达，延缓疾病进展，为DPN的中医治疗提供参考。||Diabetes peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes, which can lead to foot ulcers, gangrene, and in severe cases, amputation, thereby affecting the quality of life of patients. DPN falls within the scope of traditional Chinese medicine as "arthritis" and "muscular atrophy," primarily characterized by deficiency of qi, blood, yin, and yang, phlegm-dampness and blood stasis obstructing the meridians. Clinically, qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome are most commonly observed. Based on the theory from "The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine" that "qi and pulse should always be unblocked," this paper proposes that the treatment for patients with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome in DPN should follow the principle of "tonifying qi, activating blood circulation, resolving stasis, and dredging the meridians," aiming to achieve free flow of qi and pulse in patients, delay disease progression, and provide reference for the TCM treatment of DPN.

Currently, there is no clear solution for the reproductive damage caused by Tripterygium glycosides. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium glycosides is attributed to its pungent and bitter cold nature; long-term use can dry liver blood, injure liver yang, consume kidney essence, and damage kidney yang, disrupting the balance of qi, blood, yin, and yang in the zang-fu organs, leading to infertility. This paper proposes understanding the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium glycosides from the perspective of "the source of yin and yang being the same," based on the relationship between the liver and kidneys and human reproductive function, and explores methods to reduce reproductive toxicity according to the concept of "treating the liver and kidneys together," aiming to broaden the theoretical thinking in TCM for safe clinical application.

Methods Retrieve clinical research literature on TCM treatment of SAP from CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP Database, and SinoMed up to February 28, 2022. Use Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, and SPSS Statistics 22.0 software to perform frequency statistics, cluster analysis, and association rule analysis on Chinese herbal medicine data, summarizing core prescriptions. Results A total of 289 prescriptions involving 185 types of Chinese herbs and 38 types of TCM syndromes were included. Based on the overall study of SAP "disease," the main treatments include drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, tonifying deficiency and reinforcing the body, and regulating qi and resolving phlegm. Commonly used herbs include Chuanxiong, Danshen, Glycyrrhiza, Astragalus, and Angelica; commonly used herb pairs include Chuanxiong-Angelica, Chuanxiong-Carthamus, and Chuanxiong-Zhi Shi. Drug complex network diagrams and cluster analysis show that Buyang Huanwu Decoction is the basic prescription for treating SAP. Based on the study of SAP "syndrome," Qi deficiency and blood stasis, phlegm-blood stasis, and qi stagnation and blood stasis are relatively common TCM syndromes in SAP, with warm and neutral properties being predominant in medication; flavors are mainly sweet, pungent, and bitter, often affecting the liver, spleen, lung, and heart meridians. Among them, Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome uses Buyang Huanwu Decoction as the basic prescription composed of high-frequency drugs such as Astragalus, Chuanxiong, and Danshen; phlegm-blood stasis syndrome often uses Gu Lou Xie Bai Ban Xia Tang combined with Tao Hong Si Wu Tang as the basic prescription composed of high-frequency drugs such as processed Pinellia, Chuanxiong, and Allium; qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome uses Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang as the basic prescription composed of high-frequency drugs such as Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Citrus aurantium. Cluster analysis shows that Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome can be divided into 3 categories, while phlegm-blood stasis syndrome can be divided into 4 categories. Conclusion Deficiency, blood stasis, phlegm, and stagnation are important pathogenic factors in SAP, among which qi deficiency is the basis of onset, blood stasis runs through the entire disease, or may be accompanied by phlegm-dampness and qi stagnation. Around the pathogenesis of fundamental deficiency and superficial excess, clinical treatment mostly uses tonifying drugs and drugs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, selecting prescriptions based on syndrome differentiation.

基于络病理论，认为邪侵肺络，癌毒内蕴，逐渐形成“瘀络”“盛络”“虚络”等络脉病变，与肿瘤细胞形成的异常血管网络较为相似，可分别演变为缺氧、炎症、免疫抑制性的肿瘤微环境，影响肺癌的治疗效果。结合肿瘤生物学特性，基于叶天士“络以通为用”观点，可相应运用化瘀通络、解毒通络、益气通络之法，活用化瘀、解毒与扶正药物，靶向调节缺氧环境、炎症状态和免疫反应，有助于诱导肿瘤血管正常化，重塑肿瘤微环境，在提高联合治疗疗效的同时，也可减轻不良反应、提高患者耐受性。||Based on the theory of collateral stasis, it is considered that evil invades the lung collaterals, cancer toxicity resides internally, gradually forming "stagnant collaterals," "proliferative collaterals," and "deficient collaterals," which are similar to the abnormal vascular networks formed by tumor cells, and can respectively evolve into hypoxic, inflammatory, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, affecting the treatment outcomes of lung cancer. Combining the biological characteristics of tumors and Ye Tianshi's concept of "collaterals function by being unobstructed," corresponding methods such as promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis, detoxifying and dredging collaterals, and invigorating qi to dredge collaterals can be used flexibly. Targeted regulation of hypoxic environments, inflammatory states, and immune responses through the use of drugs for removing blood stasis, detoxification, and tonifying can help induce normalization of tumor vasculature and reshape the tumor microenvironment, thereby improving the efficacy of combined treatments while also reducing adverse reactions and enhancing patient tolerance.

中风软瘫以中风后患者身体运动功能异常，肌肉张力下降为主要表现，是中风后较为常见的病理状态，软瘫时间越长预后越差。中医理论认为，中风主因“虚、风、火、痰、瘀、气”而发病，当邪气搏结、阻于经络则使气血凝滞、经筋损伤、肌肉痿废，导致中风软瘫，因此需立以通经柔筋为其主要治法。火针治疗中风软瘫具有通经温阳、柔筋止痛的作用，可温阳散寒、充养经脉经气、松解筋脉结节、推动气血运行、濡养四肢百骸。火针疗法可促进神经通路的恢复，加强局部新陈代谢，改善局部肌张力，从而恢复肢体功能。火针治疗中风后软瘫的高质量临床研究、选穴规律、规范化操作手法等有待进一步深化。||Stroke soft paralysis is mainly characterized by abnormal motor function and decreased muscle tone in stroke patients, which is a relatively common pathological state after stroke. The longer the duration of soft paralysis, the worse the prognosis. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, stroke occurs primarily due to "deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, blood stasis, and qi". When pathogenic factors block the meridians, it leads to stagnation of qi and blood, injury to meridial sinews, and atrophy of muscles, resulting in stroke soft paralysis. Therefore, the main treatment method should focus on unblocking meridians and soothing sinews. Fire needle therapy for stroke soft paralysis has the effects of unblocking meridians, warming yang, and soothing sinews to relieve pain. It can warm yang, dispel cold, nourish the meridians and qi, release the knots of sinews and meridians, promote the circulation of qi and blood, and nourish the limbs and all body parts. Fire needle therapy can promote the recovery of neural pathways, enhance local metabolism, improve local muscle tone, and thus restore limb function. High-quality clinical studies, acupoint selection rules, and standardized operational techniques for treating post-stroke soft paralysis with fire needles require further in-depth research.

防风通圣散具有外散风热、内泻热结功效。回归刘完素学术思想本源，可知防风通圣散应以治风为标，治热为本，标本同治，表里双解，当为火热偏盛、内外俱实的病证而设。近年来，国内对本方的基础与临床研究方向主要有皮肤病、内分泌代谢疾病、消化系统疾病、呼吸系统疾病等，而国外相关研究则集中于肥胖相关的代谢疾病。研究发现，防风通圣散具有抗过敏、调节免疫、改善代谢紊乱等作用。目前，国内防风通圣散基础研究相对不足，对本方的机制探讨还需更加深入，且需开展更多大样本、高质量RCT。||Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder has the effects of dispelling wind-heat externally and clearing internal heat accumulation. Returning to the academic ideas of Liu Wansu, it can be known that Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder should focus on treating wind as the manifestation and heat as the root cause, treating both manifestation and root cause simultaneously, resolving exterior and interior symptoms together, designed for conditions with excessive fire and heat, and solidness inside and outside. In recent years, domestic research directions on this formula mainly include skin diseases, endocrine and metabolic diseases, digestive system diseases, respiratory system diseases, etc., while foreign related studies focus on metabolic diseases related to obesity. Research has found that Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder has effects such as anti-allergy, immune regulation, and improving metabolic disorders. Currently, there is relatively insufficient basic research on Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder in China, and further in-depth exploration of its mechanisms is needed, along with conducting more large-sample, high-quality RCTs.

临床可从中医“血脉之心”与“神明之心”认识双心疾病，把握“气血失和、清浊不分”的核心病机，传承并创新蒲辅周先生“畅气血、重升降”学术思想，以及国医大师薛伯寿“和合思想”，从双心失调本质出发，以“气血同调、升清降浊”为核心治法。其中，气血同调应虚实异治，若以虚为主，需体用联合以调补气血，常用双和散；以实为主，需动静结合以通顺血脉，常用黄芪赤风汤、越鞠丸。升清降浊应斡旋气机、补泻合宜，常用升降散调气开郁，补中益气汤益气升清，枳术汤、枳术丸泄浊逐秽。||Clinical recognition of double heart disease can be achieved from the perspective of "blood and qi heart" and "spiritual heart" in Traditional Chinese Medicine, grasping the core pathogenesis of "disharmony of qi and blood, unclear distinction between clear and turbid", inheriting and innovating Mr. Pu Fuzhou's academic thought of "smooth flow of qi and blood, emphasis on ascending and descending functions", as well as National Medical Master Xue Baoshou's "harmonious thought", starting from the essence of disharmony of the double heart, with "regulating qi and blood together, promoting clarity and reducing turbidity" as the core treatment method. Among them, regulating qi and blood together should be treated differently for deficiency and excess; if deficiency is predominant, body and function should be combined to regulate and replenish qi and blood, commonly using Shuanghe Powder; if excess is predominant, dynamic and static aspects should be combined to smooth the flow of blood, commonly using Huangqi Chifeng Decoction and Yueju Pills. Promoting clarity and reducing turbidity should involve rotating qi movement and appropriate tonification and purgation, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate qi and resolve depression, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to tonify qi and promote clarity, Zhizhu Decoction and Zhizhu Pills to eliminate turbidity and remove filth.

大肠息肉的临床表现与湿邪黏滞、重着等特性相符，其好发人群的中医体质多与湿相关。易引发大肠息肉的肠道菌群失调、肠道微炎症状态、神经-内分泌-免疫网络和水通道蛋白异常等病理变化与湿邪现代机制研究结果相符。认为饮食不节、情志不畅等因素导致脾虚湿蕴，各种病邪交织形成有形异物是湿邪引发大肠息肉的中医病机。根据湿邪的致病特征，结合大肠息肉的发病因素，探讨湿邪在大肠息肉发病中的影响，以期为临床中大肠息肉的中西医结合诊疗提供有效的中医理论依据。||The clinical manifestations of colorectal polyps are consistent with the characteristics of dampness such as stickiness and heaviness; the constitution of people prone to colorectal polyps is often related to dampness in traditional Chinese medicine. The pathological changes such as dysbiosis of intestinal flora, micro-inflammatory state of the intestine, abnormal neuro-endocrine-immune network, and aquaporin abnormalities that easily lead to colorectal polyps are consistent with the modern mechanism research results of dampness. It is considered that factors such as irregular diet and emotional stagnation cause spleen deficiency and dampness accumulation, and various pathogenic factors intertwine to form tangible foreign objects, which is the TCM pathogenesis of dampness causing colorectal polyps. According to the disease-causing characteristics of dampness and combined with the causative factors of colorectal polyps, the influence of dampness in the onset of colorectal polyps is discussed, aiming to provide effective TCM theoretical basis for the integrated TCM and Western medical diagnosis and treatment of colorectal polyps in clinical practice.

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。||Systematic sorting of the Longdan Xiegan Decoction in successive medical texts reveals that the original version recorded in the "Lanshi Mimi" mainly targeted male genital odor disorders. After modifications by Xue Ji, the scope of its applications gradually expanded, leading to confusion regarding the names, compositions, and origins of the formula. This issue is particularly prominent in "Jingyue Quanshu" and "Yifang Jijie." Previous medical practitioners often interpreted this prescription from the perspective of zang-fu organs; changing the perspective to meridians for re-interpretation might better elucidate the rules governing the main therapeutic effects of the Longdan Xiegan Decoction. By attributing genitourinary disorders to the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian and lateral chest pain, tinnitus, and other symptoms to the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, and adjusting medication according to the condition, it is conducive to a comprehensive and profound understanding of the prescription for accurate clinical diagnosis and medication, which can also prompt modern researchers to reconsider the significant role of the meridian theory in the formation and development of the entire TCM theoretical system.

通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。||By comparing the relevant出土文献 and 传世文献 passages, this study analyzes the treatment details of "Shiju. The best is the divine stone, which will surely cure; the second is bleeding, which can be divided; the worst is pus, with an efficacy rate of eleven out of ten" in the "Reversal and Sequence of Five Colors and Visceral Examination of Spirit" chapter of the "Tianhui Medical Text", elucidating its connection with the theoretical system of extant medical classics. Compared to the stone puncture methods in the Mawangdui "Pulse Methods" and the Zhangjiashan "Pulse Texts", the method of using "divine stone" for treating carbuncles and boils in the "Tianhui Medical Text" can prevent the progression of the disease before the aggregation of blood and the formation of pus, achieving the effect of "surely cured". Additionally, the diagnostic and therapeutic methods related to stone carbuncle may have inspired to some extent the subsequent "regulation of spirit" concept and the theory of treating diseases before they occur.
