The "qi collaterals-blood collaterals" theory is an applied theory developed based on the collateral disease theory. Understanding the pathogenesis of AR in children from the perspective of damage to collaterals, the damage and consumption to qi collaterals of the lung, spleen, and kidney is the basis for the occurrence and development of AR in children, the imbalance of qi and blood is the core pathogenesis, and wind, cold, phlegm, and blood stasis are the important pathological factors. Moreover, long-term illness can deeply affect the blood, further progressing to damage blood collaterals. Since the pathogenesis of AR is a combination of deficiency and excess, this article aims to provide a new theoretical basis and practical guidance for TCM treatment of AR in children based on the treatment principles of "treating excess with unblocking collaterals and treating deficiency with tonifying collaterals".
