Methods HPLC was used to establish the fingerprint chromatograms of the traditional decoction and medicinal granules of Sangju Yin. The differences in chemical composition between the traditional decoction and medicinal granules of Sangju Yin were analyzed from four aspects: types of chemical components, similarity of fingerprint chromatograms, chemical pattern recognition analysis, and content of representative indicator components. Results The similarity of fingerprint chromatograms of 10 batches of traditional decoctions was >0.988, with 35 characteristic peaks identified, among which 12 common peaks were assigned (Peak 7: neochlorogenic acid, Peak 10: chlorogenic acid, Peak 11: cryptochlorogenic acid, Peak 13: 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, Peak 17: rutin, Peak 19: forsythoside A, Peak 20: luteoloside, Peak 24: isochlorogenic acid B, Peak 25: 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, Peak 31: forsythin, Peak 32: buddleoside, Peak 35: ammonium glycyrrhizinate); the similarity of fingerprint chromatograms of medicinal granules was >0.983, with 29 characteristic peaks identified. Compared with the traditional decoction, some batches of medicinal granules lacked peaks 14, 26, 27, 30, 32, and 34. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis could distinguish between the two. The content of indicator components neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythoside A, luteoloside, isochlorogenic acid B, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythin, and buddleoside in the traditional decoction was higher than that in the medicinal granules, while the content of rutin and ammonium glycyrrhizinate in the medicinal granules was higher than that in the traditional decoction. Conclusion There are differences in the types and content of components between Sangju Yin medicinal granules and traditional decoction-ready medicines. The combination of fingerprint chromatograms and chemical pattern recognition can effectively evaluate the differences between the traditional decoction and medicinal granules of Sangju Yin, laying a foundation for the quality control and rational clinical application of Sangju Yin medicinal granules.

女性宫颈癌的发生与高危型人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）感染关系密切，及时有效地阻断高危型 HPV 感染对预防宫颈癌的发生有重要意义。黄元御的“一气周流”理论思想崇尚中土，注重整体气机的调畅，可阐释女性的生理病理。而高危型 HPV 感染的发生与中焦脾土失运，气机周流不畅，机体抗邪能力低下致清浊升降失常有关。基于“一气周流”理论结合“治未病”思想，笔者提出“未病先防，调畅中土存正气”“既病防变，升降相因祛毒邪”“瘥后防复，阴阳平衡和气血”的高危型 HPV 感染的防治原则，以期为临床治疗提供参考。||The occurrence of cervical cancer in women is closely related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Timely and effective prevention of high-risk HPV infection is of great significance in preventing cervical cancer. Huang Yuan-yu's theory of "One Qi Circulating" emphasizes the importance of the Middle Jiao and the smooth movement of Qi, which can explain the physiological and pathological conditions of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is related to the dysfunction of the Middle Jiao and Spleen, the stagnation of Qi movement, and the decline of the body's ability to resist pathogens, leading to the imbalance of the ascending and descending of clear and turbid Qi. Based on the theory of "One Qi Circulating" combined with the concept of "Preventing a disease before it arises," the author proposes the prevention and treatment principles for high-risk HPV infection: "Preventing a disease before it arises by regulating the Middle Jiao and preserving Healthy Qi," "Preventing transmission of a disease after its onset by balancing the ascending and descending to eliminate Toxic Pathogens," and "Preventing recurrence after recovery by balancing Yin-Yang and harmonizing Qi and Blood," aiming to provide references for clinical treatment.

The pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by deficiency of heart qi and heart yang, prolonged dysfunction of qi transformation in the Sanjiao, and progression from deficiency to excess in the later stages, manifesting as a combination of deficiency and excess. The Linggui Zhugan Decoction (abbreviated as "Linggui Zhugan Tang") exerts its effects through the "four-in-one" approach: the nature of the formula is acrid, sweet, and warm, with a combination of bland sweetness and bitterness, where the acrid and sweet warmth transforms qi to promote urination and supports yang to eliminate retained fluids, while the bland bitterness seeps water and dries dampness, facilitating the water passages; the location is the heart, spleen, and Sanjiao, which can invigorate heart yang, strengthen the spleen to eliminate retained fluids, and regulate the water passages of the Sanjiao; the tendency is to act both upwards and downwards, internally and externally, promoting the upper and benefiting the lower, dispersing externally and supplementing internally, thereby facilitating the water passages of the Sanjiao; the pattern is deficiency of heart yang and flooding of water and phlegm-fluid retention, commonly used in the treatment of water qi surging heart disease. Dysfunction of the Sanjiao and the recurrence of CHF are mutually causative, and Linggui Zhugan Tang can warm the fire of qi transformation in the Sanjiao and clear the pathways of qi transformation in the Sanjiao, addressing the systemic fluid retention in CHF; its pharmacological effects include anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of myocardial cell membrane ion channels, anti-ischemia-reperfusion injury, and modulation of vascular tone. Deconstructing Linggui Zhugan Tang from the "four-in-one" perspective and exploring its mechanism in treating CHF in conjunction with the theory of "Sanjiao qi transformation" is of significant importance for revitalizing the vitality of classical formulas and their precise and effective application.

尿毒症瘙痒（UP）是终末期肾脏病患者常见并发症，严重降低患者生活质量。中医外治法治疗 UP 相较于中药内治法操作简便、起效迅速，且能避免口服药物所致首关效应及可能带来肝肾损伤，治疗手段主要包括中药外洗、药浴、熏洗、湿敷、灌肠、刮痧、针刺、耳穴贴压、穴位敷贴、穴位离子导入、自体血穴位注射等。目前，多数研究在西医常规治疗基础上加用中医外治法，可提高疗效，在改善瘙痒症状、炎症指标、睡眠质量及焦虑抑郁状态等方面具有一定优势；一些研究选取甲状旁腺激素、血磷、CRP、IL-6、组胺、SCr、BUN、β2-微球蛋白等指标评价疗效，结果提示中医外治法可改善患者微炎症状态，保护肾功能，但其作用机制有待进一步研究。现有研究存在以下问题：临床疗效评价量表不统一，难以横向比较和总结；瘙痒症状的缓解依据量表评判，主观性较强；研究疗程较短，无法评判远期疗效和安全性；部分研究未指明患者证型，难以体现中医辨证论治优势等，今后还需完善。||Uremic pruritus (UP) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, severely reducing their quality of life. Compared to internal treatment with Chinese herbal medicines, external treatment methods in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for UP are simpler to operate, have a rapid onset of effect, and can avoid the first-pass effect and potential liver and kidney damage caused by oral medications. Treatment methods mainly include external washing with Chinese herbal medicines, medicinal baths, fumigation and washing, wet compresses, enemas, gua sha, acupuncture, ear point pressing, acupoint application, acupoint iontophoresis, and autologous blood point injection. Currently, most studies add TCM external treatment methods on the basis of conventional Western medical treatment, which can improve efficacy and have certain advantages in improving pruritus symptoms, inflammatory indicators, sleep quality, and anxiety and depression states. Some studies have selected indicators such as parathyroid hormone, blood phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, and β2-microglobulin to evaluate efficacy, and the results suggest that TCM external treatment methods can improve the micro-inflammatory state of patients and protect renal function, but the mechanism of action needs further research. Existing studies have the following problems: clinical efficacy evaluation scales are not unified, making it difficult to compare and summarize horizontally; the relief of pruritus symptoms is judged based on scales, which is highly subjective; the research courses are short, making it impossible to judge long-term efficacy and safety; some studies do not specify the patient's pattern, making it difficult to reflect the advantages of TCM pattern identification and treatment, etc., which need to be improved in the future.

通过挖掘醒脑开窍理论的核心思想，分析醒脑开窍理论与中医脑病的关系，探究针灸辨治中医脑病的必要性，以明晰针灸脑病当如何辨证论治。“醒脑开窍”是调神理论的核心，是立足于醒脑、醒神、调神的原则而确立，其调神思想与中医脑病证治密不可分。基于针灸疗法的特色及中医脑病的复杂性和特殊性，针灸治疗脑病理应有其独特的辨证论治体系。针灸实践过程中，中医脑病证治当以“脑”为本，以“醒神调神”为总治则，在“醒脑开窍针法”主穴基础上化裁，针对不同脑病配合相应的治法。||By excavating the core ideas of the theory of awakening the brain and opening the orifices, analyzing the relationship between the theory of awakening the brain and opening the orifices and brain diseases in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and exploring the necessity of acupuncture in the pattern identification and treatment of brain diseases in TCM, we aim to clarify how acupuncture should be applied to brain diseases based on pattern identification and treatment. "Awakening the brain and opening the orifices" is the core of the theory of regulating the spirit, established on the principles of awakening the brain, awakening the spirit, and regulating the spirit. Its idea of regulating the spirit is closely related to the pattern identification and treatment of brain diseases in TCM. Based on the characteristics of acupuncture therapy and the complexity and specificity of brain diseases in TCM, acupuncture treatment for brain diseases should have its unique system of pattern identification and treatment. In the practice of acupuncture, the treatment of brain diseases in TCM should be based on the "brain" as the foundation, with "awakening and regulating the spirit" as the general treatment principle. It should be adapted on the basis of the main points of the "acupuncture method for awakening the brain and opening the orifices," and combined with corresponding treatment methods for different brain diseases.

糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）为糖尿病常见慢性并发症，可导致足部溃疡、坏疽，严重者可导致截肢，影响患者生活质量。DPN属中医“痹病”“痿病”等范畴，主要病机为气血阴阳亏虚，痰浊瘀血痹阻脉络，临床以气虚血瘀证多见。本文基于《黄帝内经》“气脉常通”理论，提出DPN气虚血瘀证患者的治疗应以“益气活血、化瘀通痹”为原则，使患者气脉通达，延缓疾病进展，为DPN的中医治疗提供参考。||Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes, which can lead to foot ulcers and gangrene, and in severe cases, amputation, affecting the quality of life of patients. DPN falls under the categories of "Bi-impediment disorders" and "Impediment disorders" in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with the main pathogenesis being deficiency of Qi, Blood, Yin, and Yang, and obstruction of the vessels by Phlegm and Static blood. Clinically, the pattern of Qi deficiency induced blood stasis is commonly seen. Based on the theory of "unobstructed Qi and vessels" from the "Huangdi Neijing" (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine), this article proposes that the treatment of DPN patients with the Qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern should follow the principle of "tonifying Qi, activating Blood, resolving stasis, and unblocking impediment" to ensure the unobstructed flow of Qi and vessels, delay disease progression, and provide a reference for the TCM treatment of DPN.

Its core pathogenesis is the disorder of Qi and Blood, damage to the Spirit, dysfunction of ascending and descending, and stagnation of the pivotal movement. The treatment should focus on regulating the ascending and descending of Qi and Blood, with the aim of tonifying Qi and activating Blood, and regulating the ascending and descending. Among these, tonifying Qi should be prioritized, and Blood-activating herbs should be appropriately selected according to the degree of Blood stasis to ensure the smooth flow of the Vessels and the reliance of the Spirit. Regulating the ascending and descending should focus on adjusting the ascending of the Liver and the descending of the Lung, as well as the Spleen and Stomach. Attention should be paid to the properties of ascending, descending, floating, and sinking of the herbs, in accordance with the physiological functions of the Zang–fu organs, to restore the ascending and descending movements of Qi in the Zang–fu organs.

Currently, there is no clear solution for the reproductive damage caused by Tripterygium wilfordii. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii is attributed to its bitter, acrid, cold, and cool properties. Prolonged use can dry Liver blood, damage Liver yang, deplete Kidney essence, and impair Kidney yang, disrupting the balance of Qi, blood, Yin, and Yang in the Zang-fu organs, leading to infertility. Based on the connection between the Liver and Kidney and human reproductive functions, this article proposes understanding the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii from the perspective of "Liver and Kidney sharing the same source" (Yi and Gui sharing the same source), and explores methods to reduce its reproductive toxicity according to the principle of "simultaneous treatment of Liver and Kidney," aiming to expand TCM theoretical considerations for its safe clinical application.

Methods Clinical research literature on TCM treatment of SAP was retrieved from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (Chongqing VIP), and SinoMed up to February 28, 2022. The frequency statistics, cluster analysis, and association rule analysis of TCM data were performed using Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, and SPSS Statistics 22.0 software to summarize the core prescriptions. Results A total of 289 prescriptions were included, involving 185 Chinese herbal medicines and 38 TCM patterns. Based on the overall study of SAP as a "disease," it was found that clinical treatment of SAP mainly focuses on blood-activating and stasis-transforming medicines, tonic and deficiency-supplementing medicines, and qi-regulating and phlegm-transforming medicines. The frequently used Chinese herbal medicines include Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), Gancao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), Huangqi (Astragalus membranaceus), and Danggui (Angelica sinensis). Commonly used herb pairs include Chuanxiong-Danggui, Chuanxiong-Honghua (Carthamus tinctorius), and Chuanxiong-Zhishi (Citrus aurantium). The complex network diagram and cluster analysis of the medicines revealed that the modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction is the basic prescription for treating SAP. Based on the study of SAP "patterns," it was found that qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern, intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern, and qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern are the more common TCM patterns of SAP, with the medicines used mainly being warm and neutral in nature. The flavors of the medicines are mainly sweet, pungent, and bitter, and they mostly belong to the liver, spleen, lung, and heart meridians. Among them, the qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern uses the Buyang Huanwu Decoction composed of high-frequency medicines such as Huangqi, Chuanxiong, and Danshen as the basic prescription. The intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern often uses the Gualou Xiebai Banxia Decoction combined with Taohong Siwu Decoction composed of high-frequency medicines such as Banxia (Pinellia ternata), Chuanxiong, and Xiebai (Allium macrostemon) as the basic prescription. The qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern uses the Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction composed of high-frequency medicines such as Chuanxiong, Danggui, and Zhiqiao (Citrus aurantium) as the basic prescription. The cluster analysis of the medicines for the qi deficiency induced blood stasis pattern and qi stagnation and blood stasis pattern can be divided into 3 categories, while the intertwined phlegm and blood stasis pattern can be divided into 4 categories. Conclusion Deficiency, stasis, phlegm, and stagnation are important pathological factors of SAP, among which qi deficiency is the basis of the disease, and blood stasis runs through the entire course of the disease, sometimes accompanied by phlegm turbidity and qi stagnation patterns. Focusing on the pathogenesis of root deficiency and branch excess, clinical treatment often uses tonic medicines and blood-activating and stasis-transforming medicines, with pattern identification guiding the selection of prescriptions.

基于络病理论，认为邪侵肺络，癌毒内蕴，逐渐形成“瘀络”“盛络”“虚络”等络脉病变，与肿瘤细胞形成的异常血管网络较为相似，可分别演变为缺氧、炎症、免疫抑制性的肿瘤微环境，影响肺癌的治疗效果。结合肿瘤生物学特性，基于叶天士“络以通为用”观点，可相应运用化瘀通络、解毒通络、益气通络之法，活用化瘀、解毒与扶正药物，靶向调节缺氧环境、炎症状态和免疫反应，有助于诱导肿瘤血管正常化，重塑肿瘤微环境，在提高联合治疗疗效的同时，也可减轻不良反应、提高患者耐受性。||Based on the theory of collateral disease, it is believed that pathogenic factors invade the lung collaterals, leading to the internal accumulation of cancer toxins, which gradually form collateral lesions such as "stasis collaterals," "exuberant collaterals," and "deficient collaterals." These lesions are quite similar to the abnormal vascular networks formed by tumor cells and can evolve into hypoxic, inflammatory, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, affecting the treatment efficacy of lung cancer. Combining the biological characteristics of tumors and based on Ye Tianshi's view that "collaterals should be unblocked for function," corresponding methods such as transforming stasis and unblocking collaterals, detoxifying and unblocking collaterals, and tonifying qi and unblocking collaterals can be applied. By flexibly using stasis-transforming, detoxifying, and qi-tonifying drugs, targeted regulation of the hypoxic environment, inflammatory state, and immune response can be achieved, which helps induce tumor vascular normalization and reshape the tumor microenvironment. This approach not only enhances the efficacy of combination therapy but also reduces adverse reactions and improves patient tolerance.

中风软瘫以中风后患者身体运动功能异常，肌肉张力下降为主要表现，是中风后较为常见的病理状态，软瘫时间越长预后越差。中医理论认为，中风主因“虚、风、火、痰、瘀、气”而发病，当邪气搏结、阻于经络则使气血凝滞、经筋损伤、肌肉痿废，导致中风软瘫，因此需立以通经柔筋为其主要治法。火针治疗中风软瘫具有通经温阳、柔筋止痛的作用，可温阳散寒、充养经脉经气、松解筋脉结节、推动气血运行、濡养四肢百骸。火针疗法可促进神经通路的恢复，加强局部新陈代谢，改善局部肌张力，从而恢复肢体功能。火针治疗中风后软瘫的高质量临床研究、选穴规律、规范化操作手法等有待进一步深化。||Wind stroke flaccidity is primarily characterized by abnormal motor function and decreased muscle tone in patients after a wind stroke, representing a common pathological state post-stroke. The longer the duration of flaccidity, the worse the prognosis. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, wind stroke is mainly caused by "deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, stasis, and qi." When pathogenic qi accumulates and obstructs the meridians and collaterals, it leads to stagnation of qi and blood, damage to the sinews, and muscle flaccidity, resulting in wind stroke flaccidity. Therefore, the primary treatment principle is to unblock the meridians and soften the sinews. Fire needling therapy for wind stroke flaccidity has the effects of unblocking meridians, tonifying yang, softening sinews, and relieving pain. It can warm yang and dissipate cold, nourish the qi of meridians, loosen sinew nodules, promote the circulation of qi and blood, and nourish the limbs and body. Fire needling therapy can promote the recovery of neural pathways, enhance local metabolism, improve local muscle tone, and thereby restore limb function. High-quality clinical research, acupoint selection patterns, and standardized techniques for fire needling therapy in treating post-stroke flaccidity require further exploration.

Returning to the academic origin of Liu Wansu, it is known that Fangfeng Tongsheng San should treat wind as the tip and heat as the root, treating both the tip and root simultaneously, resolving both the exterior and interior, and is designed for patterns of excessive fire-heat with both internal and external excess. In recent years, domestic research on this formula has mainly focused on skin diseases, endocrine and metabolic diseases, digestive system diseases, and respiratory system diseases, while foreign research has concentrated on obesity-related metabolic diseases. Studies have found that Fangfeng Tongsheng San has anti-allergic, immune-regulating, and metabolic disorder-improving effects. Currently, domestic basic research on Fangfeng Tongsheng San is relatively insufficient, and the mechanism of this formula needs to be explored more deeply, with more large-sample, high-quality RCTs required.

This approach involves inheriting and innovating the academic thoughts of Mr. Pu Fuzhou, who emphasized "smoothing Qi and Blood, and valuing ascending and descending," as well as the "Harmony and Integration Thought" of Master Xue Boshou, a renowned TCM practitioner. Starting from the essence of dual-heart disharmony, the core treatment method focuses on "regulating Qi and Blood together, and ascending the clear and descending the turbid." In regulating Qi and Blood, treatment should differ based on deficiency and excess. If deficiency is predominant, it is necessary to combine body and function to regulate and supplement Qi and Blood, commonly using Shuanghe Powder. If excess is predominant, it requires a combination of movement and stillness to smooth the Blood Vessels, commonly using Huangqi Chifeng Decoction and Yueju Pill. In ascending the clear and descending the turbid, it is essential to harmonize Qi movement and balance supplementation and purgation, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate Qi and relieve depression, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to tonify Qi and ascend the clear, and Zhizhu Decoction and Zhizhu Pill to purge the turbid and expel filth.

大肠息肉的临床表现与湿邪黏滞、重着等特性相符，其好发人群的中医体质多与湿相关。易引发大肠息肉的肠道菌群失调、肠道微炎症状态、神经-内分泌-免疫网络和水通道蛋白异常等病理变化与湿邪现代机制研究结果相符。认为饮食不节、情志不畅等因素导致脾虚湿蕴，各种病邪交织形成有形异物是湿邪引发大肠息肉的中医病机。根据湿邪的致病特征，结合大肠息肉的发病因素，探讨湿邪在大肠息肉发病中的影响，以期为临床中大肠息肉的中西医结合诊疗提供有效的中医理论依据。||The clinical manifestations of colorectal polyps are consistent with the characteristics of dampness such as its viscous and heavy nature. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution of the population prone to colorectal polyps is often related to dampness. Pathological changes such as intestinal dysbiosis, intestinal micro-inflammatory state, neuro-endocrine-immune network abnormalities, and aquaporin abnormalities that are prone to cause colorectal polyps are consistent with modern research findings on the mechanisms of dampness. It is believed that factors such as dietary irregularities and emotional disturbances lead to spleen deficiency and dampness accumulation, and the intertwining of various pathogenic factors forms tangible foreign bodies, which is the TCM pathogenesis of dampness causing colorectal polyps. Based on the pathogenic characteristics of dampness and the factors contributing to the onset of colorectal polyps, this study explores the influence of dampness in the pathogenesis of colorectal polyps, aiming to provide effective TCM theoretical basis for the integrated diagnosis and treatment of colorectal polyps in clinical practice.

五善七恶是一种判断中医外科疾病预后的理论，被诸多中医古籍提及，为历代外科医家重视，但现代文献对其论述较少。五善七恶首见于《太平圣惠方》，其理论源自《灵枢·玉版》中的“逆顺”。五善七恶经过历代医家的发挥，衍生出诸多变体。通过梳理历代医籍对五善七恶的记载，发现主要版本有两大类：一是《太平圣惠方》版及其衍生版（痘疹五善七恶、五善七恶救援法等）；二是《外科正宗》版及其衍生版。||The theory of Five Favorable Signs and Seven Adverse Signs is a prognostic framework used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) surgery, frequently mentioned in numerous ancient TCM texts and highly valued by surgical practitioners throughout history. However, modern literature provides limited discussion on this topic. The concept of Five Favorable Signs and Seven Adverse Signs first appeared in the "Taiping Shenghui Fang" and originates from the "Nishun" (Adverse and Favorable) theory in the "Lingshu·Yuban." Over generations, this theory has been expanded upon by various medical practitioners, leading to numerous variants. By reviewing historical medical texts, it is evident that there are two main versions of this theory: one is the "Taiping Shenghui Fang" version and its derivatives (such as the Five Favorable Signs and Seven Adverse Signs for Smallpox and the Rescue Methods for Five Favorable Signs and Seven Adverse Signs); the other is the "Waike Zhengzong" version and its derivatives.

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。||A systematic review of the historical medical texts on Longdan Xiegan Tang reveals that the original formulation recorded in "Lan Shi Mi Cang" primarily targeted the disease of foul odor in the anterior yin of males. Through the modifications by Xue Ji, the scope of its indications gradually expanded and generalized, leading to confusion in the nomenclature, composition, and origins of the formula. This issue is particularly evident in "Jingyue Quanshu" and "Yifang Jijie." Previous physicians often interpreted this formula from the perspective of Zang–fu organs. Shifting the perspective to interpret it from the viewpoint of meridians may provide a better understanding of the therapeutic principles of Longdan Xiegan Tang. By attributing diseases of the anterior yin to the liver meridian of foot-Jueyin and conditions such as pain in the subcostal region and deafness to the gallbladder meridian of foot-Shaoyang, and adjusting the medication based on the disease condition, it not only facilitates a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the formula to achieve precise clinical pattern identification and medication but also prompts modern researchers to reconsider the significant role of the theory of meridians and collaterals in the formation and development of the entire theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine.

《本草纲目》作为明代代表性本草著作，书中所附植物图像以另一种形式保留了李时珍对药材基原植物的考证结果，真实反映了明代对药物与植物的认识与利用情况。以书中木部香木类植物图像为例，通过考证图像所绘植物基原，以揭示明代对植物知识与药物性质的认识水平。木部香木类所载的 25 幅图像中，20 幅图像准确描述了植物的叶花及果实等，杉图对植物三尖杉形态细节的表述等均证明了明代对植物形态与药物性质认识处于较高水平。但乌药、阿魏等共 5 图的错误也说明明代对植物形态的认识仍有局限之处。通过图像考证结果与文字所载药性对比可知，明代对药性的了解程度已然鞭辟着里，对部分植物的药性认识甚至高于对其形态的了解。||The "Compendium of Materia Medica," as a representative work of Materia Medica from the Ming Dynasty, includes plant illustrations that preserve Li Shizhen's research on the original plants of medicinal materials in another form, truly reflecting the understanding and utilization of drugs and plants during the Ming Dynasty. Taking the illustrations of aromatic wood plants in the wood section as an example, by researching the original plants depicted in the illustrations, we can reveal the level of understanding of plant knowledge and medicinal properties during the Ming Dynasty. Among the 25 illustrations in the aromatic wood section, 20 accurately describe the leaves, flowers, and fruits of the plants. The detailed depiction of the morphology of Cephalotaxus in the fir illustration demonstrates the high level of understanding of plant morphology and medicinal properties during the Ming Dynasty. However, errors in the illustrations of Lindera aggregata and Ferula, among others, indicate that there were still limitations in the understanding of plant morphology during that period. By comparing the results of image research with the medicinal properties recorded in the text, it is evident that the Ming Dynasty had a profound understanding of medicinal properties, with knowledge of the medicinal properties of some plants even surpassing their understanding of their morphology.

通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。||By analyzing the relevant unearthed texts and the transmitted medical literature, this study deciphers the treatment details of "Stony gangrene. The supreme Stony Spirit, the Stony Spirit will surely be cured; the next is Stony Blood, the Stony Blood must be differentiated; the lowest is Stony Pus, the Stony Pus has a ten to one chance of survival" in the "Inverse and Sequential Five Colours Vessel Zang Examination of Essence and Spirit" from the Tianhui Medical Bamboo Slips, and elucidates its connection with the theories of transmitted medical classics. Compared to the Bian-stone needling methods in the "Vessel Methods" from Mawangdui and the "Vessel Book" from Zhangjiashan, the "Stony Spirit" method for treating abscess and deep-rooted ulcer in the Tianhui Medical Bamboo Slips is applied before the blood accumulation and pus formation of abscess and deep-rooted ulcer, which can prevent the progression of the disease and achieve the effect of "surely cured". Additionally, the diagnostic and treatment methods related to Stony gangrene may have inspired the later thoughts of "regulating the Spirit" and the theory of "Preventing a disease before it arises" to some extent.

《伤寒类证便览》是明新安医家陆彦功编集整理的一部伤寒类医籍，计 12 卷，初刊于明弘治十二年（1499）。国内外现存有 3 种版本：一种为藏于日本内阁文库全本和辽宁中医药大学图书馆藏的残本，两地藏本均为婺源汪范依据陆氏保和堂于明弘治十二年刊本进行缮写翻刻的刻本，刊刻时间不详，原保和堂弘治十二年刊本未见；一种为藏于四川省图书馆的所谓“明弘治刻本”；一种为藏于上海中医药大学图书馆的清代精抄本。其文献来源主要有《伤寒类证》《注解伤寒论》《伤寒明理论》《活人书》《太平惠民和剂局方》《此事难知》《伤寒图歌活人指掌》《胎产药方》《小儿伤寒药方》。该书使已经亡佚的《伤寒类证》得以较完整地流传下来。||"Shanghan Leizheng Bianlan" is a medical text on Cold Damage compiled and organized by the Ming dynasty physician Lu Yangong from Xin'an, comprising 12 volumes, first published in the 12th year of the Hongzhi era (1499) of the Ming dynasty. There are currently three extant versions: one is a complete copy housed in the Japanese Cabinet Library and a partial copy in the library of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, both of which are transcriptions and reprints based on the Hongzhi 12th year edition by Wang Fan of Wuyuan from Lu's Baohetang, with the exact reprint date unknown, and the original Baohetang Hongzhi 12th year edition is not seen; another is the so-called "Hongzhi era edition" stored in the Sichuan Provincial Library; and the third is a fine Qing dynasty manuscript kept in the library of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The sources of the literature mainly include "Shanghan Leizheng," "Annotations on the Treatise on Cold Damage," "Theoretical Clarifications on Cold Damage," "The Book for Saving Lives," "The Formulary of the Taiping Welfare Dispensary Bureau," "This Matter is Hard to Know," "Illustrated Songs and Guide to Saving Lives in Cold Damage," "Prescriptions for Obstetrics," and "Pediatric Prescriptions for Cold Damage." This book has allowed the otherwise lost "Shanghan Leizheng" to be relatively completely preserved and passed down.
