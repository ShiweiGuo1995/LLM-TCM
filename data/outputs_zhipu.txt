For those friends who frequently suffer from cough and panting, it is advisable to use the approach of "astringe the lung and alleviate panting" to relieve symptoms. Especially when encountering the "blood cold pattern," the body tends to feel cold and painful, necessitating the warming of meridians and dissipating cold. Male friends who unfortunately develop "inflammatory infection of the testis and epididymis" should not neglect it and should promptly adopt the treatment plan of "remove toxins and resolve sores/ulcers." Additionally, the "wind phlegm obstructing the meridians pattern" often manifests as limb numbness and difficulty in movement; TCM emphasizes "unity of upper and lower," and appropriate exercise combined with treatment yields better results. As for "bone tuberculosis," although relatively rare, it should also be taken seriously and promptly treated. It is hoped that everyone can safeguard their health through the wisdom of TCM.

顿咳与肺痈在中医理论中均为肺系疾病，二者虽病因病机各异，但均与中焦运化失职相关。肺为气之主，中焦为气血生化之源，若中焦失调，则津能载气功能受阻，导致肺气郁闭，发为顿咳；若痰湿内生，久蕴化热，痰热互结，则可形成肺痈。此外，寒性凝滞易致痰凝胞宫证，影响冲任二脉，进而引发遗尿、颤症等症。由此可见，中焦功能失调在肺系疾病及妇科杂病的发病中具有重要作用，临证时应注重调畅中焦，以恢复津能载气之职。||Whooping cough and lung abscess are both diseases of the Lung system in traditional Chinese medicine theory. Although their causative factors and pathogenesis differ, they are both related to the dysfunction of the Middle jiao. The lung is the master of qi, and the Middle jiao is the source of qi and blood transformation. If the Middle jiao is out of balance, the function of body fluids carrying qi is impeded, leading to Lung qi stagnation and the onset of whooping cough. If phlegm-dampness internally generates and accumulates to transform into heat, with phlegm and heat intermingling, it can result in a lung abscess. Additionally, cold congeals and stagnates, easily causing the phlegm retention in the uterus pattern, which affects the Chong and Ren vessels, thereby triggering symptoms such as enuresis and tremor syndrome. Thus, it is evident that the dysfunction of the Middle jiao plays a significant role in the onset of Lung system diseases and various gynecological disorders. In clinical practice, attention should be paid to regulating and smoothing the Middle jiao to restore the function of body fluids carrying qi.

Paediatric pneumonia is also closely related to spleen deficiency; when the spleen fails to transport properly, internal phlegm-dampness is generated, obstructing the airways. Additionally, abnormal white leukorrhea can be regarded as a manifestation of spleen deficiency and dampness. Children with paralysis often suffer from weak spleen and stomach, affecting the generation of Qi and Blood, thereby exacerbating the condition. A comprehensive analysis reveals that Wasting of the spleen plays a significant role in paediatric disorders, and treatment should focus on tonifying the spleen and supplementing Qi to achieve the effect of treating both the tip and root.

在探讨中医证候时，喉咳与疰夏常被视为季节性疾病的典型表现。喉咳多因肺气不宣，而疰夏则源于暑湿困脾，脾主肌肉功能失调。进一步分析，骨痨患者常伴有血瘀之象，病势缠绵。舌诊中，白黏苔的出现提示痰湿内阻，与阴黄病、萎黄病的病机密切相关。阴黄病多因寒湿内蕴，而萎黄病则多由脾胃虚弱、气血生化不足所致。综合上述病证，可知脏腑功能失调、气血瘀滞是致病关键，治疗时应注重调和脾胃、活血化瘀。||In exploring TCM patterns, laryngitis and summer non-acclimatization are often considered typical manifestations of seasonal diseases. Laryngitis is mostly due to the failure of lung qi to disperse, while summer non-acclimatization originates from the encumbrance of damp-heat on the spleen, leading to dysfunction of the spleen governing muscles. Further analysis reveals that patients with flowing phlegm disorder often present with signs of blood stasis, with a lingering disease progression. In tongue diagnosis, the appearance of a white, sticky coating indicates internal obstruction by phlegm-damp, which is closely related to the pathogenesis of Yin jaundice and iron deficiency anaemia. Yin jaundice is commonly caused by internal accumulation of cold-damp, whereas iron deficiency anaemia is mostly due to weakness of the spleen and stomach, and insufficient generation and transformation of qi and blood. Considering the above diseases and patterns, it can be understood that dysfunction of Zang-fu organs and stagnation of qi and blood are key factors in pathogenesis. Therefore, treatment should focus on regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach, as well as circulating blood and transforming stasis.

Some friends have a mixed deficiency and excess condition, suitable for the method of reinforcing healthy Qi and removing pathogenic factors simultaneously, which neither harms the healthy Qi nor fails to expel the pathogens. If there is often a pungent flavour in the mouth, it may indicate the presence of static blood in the body, requiring the use of herbs that transform stasis and stop bleeding. Patients with long-term neoplasms and carcinomas often have rough, scaly skin and a dull complexion. In addition to conventional treatment, attention should also be paid to tonifying Qi and securing the bladder to prevent the leakage of essence Qi. For friends with convulsions due to deficiency constitution, special attention should be given to daily warmth preservation, combined with appropriate dietary therapy and herbal regulation, in order to safely pass the winter.

Contagious diseases in children also commonly exhibit this transformation, due to their tender Yin and Yang constitutions, which are susceptible to external pathogenic invasions. Acute haemorrhagic necrotizing enterocolitis, as an internal injury miscellaneous disease, is mostly caused by the accumulation of damp-heat, which affects the ascending and descending of qi movement, thereby inducing gastric upset symptoms. Wind syncope and sinew impediment, although differing in causative factors, both involve qi-blood disharmony in the meridians and collaterals, with the former primarily characterized by internal movement of wind and the latter due to cold-damp obstruction in the sinews and vessels. In summary, although various patterns manifest diversely, their underlying pathogenesis shares commonalities, warranting further in-depth investigation.

Knee abscess is primarily caused by Wind causes movement, leading to local Qi and Blood stagnation; whereas hunger-related abdominal pain is closely related to Spleen yang deficiency pattern, manifested as dull pain in the abdomen. For the Qi deficiency with phlegm retention pattern, TCM advocates the supplementation of Qi and promotion of bowel movements, as well as the regulation and harmonization of the spleen and stomach. The method of pungent opening and bitter descending is suitable for such conditions, using pungent-flavored herbs to effuse and bitter-flavored herbs to descend, thereby achieving the balance of Yin–yang.

Observing tongue manifestations, a tongue with ecchymosis/petechiae indicates the presence of stagnant blood in the body, necessitating the integration of methods to resolve phlegm and eliminate stasis for regulation. Additionally, the method of mild diuresis to expel dampness helps to improve internal dampness pathogen and promote the circulation of Qi and blood.

The former is characterized by the retention of cold fluids, while the latter is dominated by the obstruction of cold phlegm. Both can be treated with the method of eliminating phlegm and unblocking bi-impediment. Leprosy, historically known as "great wind," is caused by the invasion of pathogenic wind.

Loss of voice during pregnancy is associated with dysfunction of the "mysterious mansion," which can be addressed through the "brighten the eyes" method to nourish the liver. Additionally, some people experience "tinea versicolour," which indicates an accumulation of dampness in the body and necessitates proper regulation. Of course, if "true cardiac pain" occurs, it is crucial to seek medical attention promptly and avoid any delay. It is hoped that these tips can help everyone better care for their health.

Additionally, securing and astringent methods are significantly effective for those with deficiency and excessive sweating. In acupuncture treatment, mastering the technique of reinforcing and reducing by opening and closing can precisely regulate the body. I hope everyone pays more attention to TCM health preservation in daily life to maintain good health!

中医理论中，元气为生命之本，若元气不足，易致多种病症。如妊娠期恶阻，多因胃寒气逆证所致，表现为呕吐频繁，完谷不化。治疗时应标本同治，既要温中散寒，又要补气培元。此外，皮肤疾患如蛀节疔、有头疖等，亦与体内元气亏损密切相关。通过补气固本，可增强机体抵抗力，从而达到防治疾病的目的。因此，维护元气充沛，是中医养生保健的重要原则。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, Yuan-primordial qi is the foundation of life; if Yuan-primordial qi is insufficient, it can lead to various diseases. For instance, morning sickness during pregnancy is often caused by the Cold-induced ascending of stomach qi pattern, manifested as frequent vomiting and poor digestion of food. Treatment should address both the tip and root, involving warming the middle to dispel cold and supplementing qi to nourish the Yuan-primordial qi. Additionally, skin conditions such as boils on the knuckle and headed boils are closely related to the depletion of Yuan-primordial qi within the body. By tonifying qi and strengthening the root, the body's resistance can be enhanced, thereby achieving the goal of preventing and treating diseases. Therefore, maintaining an abundance of Yuan-primordial qi is an important principle in the health preservation of traditional Chinese medicine.

If the patient exhibits signs of combined pathogens, it is advisable to flexibly apply repelling parasites methods to alleviate the urgency of insect stings/bites. Meanwhile, the method of tonifying blood and nourishing the liver should not be neglected, aiming to regulate and harmonize qi and blood, and reinforce healthy qi to eliminate pathogenic factors. For those with excessive phlegm, the technique of inducing vomiting to eliminate phlegm and salivation can rapidly expel the pathogenic factors and restore the functions of the Zang–fu organs. The various methods complement each other, thereby treating both the tip and root, and highlighting the essence of treatment based on pattern identification in TCM.

Habitual miscarriage is often due to the instability of kidney qi, while iron deficiency anaemia is usually caused by the weakness of the spleen and stomach. The symptom of oral erosion is commonly seen in the internal accumulation of damp-heat, and the treatment should involve formulas that warm and transform cold phlegm to transform phlegm and dissipate nodules. The selection of meridian points is particularly crucial, such as Zusanli (ST36) and Taichong (LR3), which can regulate the liver and spleen, and tonify qi and nourish blood. The application of the twelve needling techniques aims to dredge the meridians and collaterals and regulate and harmonize qi and blood, benefiting all the aforementioned symptoms.

在现代快节奏的生活中，我们常忽视了身体的阴阳气血津液精髓证类的平衡。比如，黄胖病就是因脾虚湿盛所致，而寒淫证则多由外感寒邪引起。男性前阴类病如转胞，更是让人苦不堪言。此时，不妨试试隔盐灸，温经散寒，调和气血。脉无胃气则是身体极度虚弱的表现，需及时调理。交会穴作为经络交汇之处，按摩刺激能有效改善多种症状。关注这些细节，才能真正做到未病先防，健康长寿。||In the fast-paced modern life, we often neglect the balance of patterns of yin, yang, qi, blood, bodily fluids, essence, and marrow. For instance, paediatric ancylostomiasis is caused by spleen deficiency and dampness excess, while the pathogenic cold pattern is usually triggered by external invasion of pathogenic cold. Disorders of the male external genitalia, such as urine retention in pregnancy, can be particularly distressing. In such cases, salt-insulated moxibustion can be tried to warm meridians and dissipate cold, and regulate and harmonize qi and blood. A pulse bereft of stomach qi indicates extreme weakness of the body, necessitating timely regulation. Crossing points, as the intersections of meridians and collaterals, can effectively improve various symptoms through tuina stimulation. Paying attention to these details is essential for truly achieving the principle of preventing a disease before it arises, leading to health and longevity.

Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "Water processing," and drinking plenty of water can help regulate the condition. Six stagnations are also common issues, and emotional disharmony can lead to Qi impediment and Blood stasis. In severe cases, it may even trigger Dysphagia, making it difficult to eat. Friends who enjoy drinking alcohol should be cautious about Alcohol-induced masses, as long-term alcohol abuse harms the body. During treatment, it is recommended to take medications in multiple times for better efficacy. If a Bluish facial complexion is observed, it may indicate an excessive Internal cold in the body, which requires timely regulation.

It often manifests as the fire hyperactivity of the heart and liver pattern, with symptoms such as lower back pain and shortness of breath. Traditional Chinese Medicine holds that the lung governs qi, and when qi collapses following heavy blood loss, the body becomes weak. It is necessary to reinforce healthy qi to eliminate pathogenic factors, harmonize the sea of blood, and restore the balance of qi and blood. At this time, formulas that clear summer heat and supplement qi, as well as nourish blood and calm the mind, should be chosen.

Although boils on the sole are considered a surgical condition, their etiology is also rooted in internal deficiency, and the method of nourishing the heart and lung can be referenced. The treatment of paediatric tonsillitis should adhere to the principle of "reinforce the mother (element) for deficiency pattern," by regulating and harmonizing the spleen and stomach to strengthen the foundation. While tinea corporis is a skin disease, its underlying mechanism of damp-heat accumulation is interconnected with the aforementioned patterns. As for transforming stasis and inducing labour, it is an emergency measure targeting specific pathological conditions during pregnancy, requiring cautious medication to prevent harm to the mother. Considering these various patterns, the subtlety of treatment based on pattern identification in Traditional Chinese Medicine becomes evident.

In fact, Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes treating according to the individual, as each person's constitution is different, and the methods of regulation vary. For example, some people are prone to wind-cold-dampness impediment, leading to joint pain; while others may experience yin exhaustion and yang collapse, resulting in symptoms such as icy limbs and profuse sweating. Flowing phlegm disorder can be particularly distressing and requires timely regulation. In terms of diet, we should pay attention to the combination of four qi and five flavours, especially since the spleen governs the limbs, and only with a healthy spleen and stomach can the limbs be strong. For the ascending of stomach qi pattern, methods such as purgation with bitter-cold can be appropriately used, but this must be done under the guidance of a professional TCM practitioner, and self-medication should be avoided.

If the spleen loses its healthy transportation function, the phlegm-dampness accumulating in the spleen pattern ensues, affecting the normal distribution of turbid semen. The wind damaging intestinal collaterals pattern is frequently seen in cases of bloody stools, and the treatment should focus on cooling the blood and stopping bleeding. Additionally, stepping manipulation, as a unique Tuina technique, can regulate and harmonize qi and blood, alleviating symptoms of limb flaccidity.

If the complexion is dim and dark, it often indicates a Qi stagnation with dampness retention pattern, which requires the use of the Penetrating Heaven coolness technique for regulation. Observing from eight directions can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the condition. The appearance of tinea pedis is mostly due to the internal accumulation of dampness pathogens, and it is necessary to combine point-pressing manipulation to dredge the meridians and collaterals. Excessive anger damages the liver, and emotional fluctuations easily lead to Liver qi stagnation, at which time it is appropriate to choose formulas that calm and nourish the mind to soothe the liver and calm the spirit.

In treating such conditions, the method of warming and transforming cold phlegm is particularly crucial, aiming to disperse internal cold phlegm through the use of warm/heat-property medicines. The carbuncle of the ankle joint pattern is mostly due to internal obstruction of phlegm-dampness, which affects the circulation of qi and blood.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that the Blood deficiency stirring wind pattern is the root cause of many diseases, especially for deafness patients who need to pay more attention to regulation. Pulse conditions are an important basis for TCM diagnosis, and abnormalities in the Yinwei meridian often indicate an imbalance of Yin–yang within the body. At this time, formulas that moisten dryness and promote bowel movements and clear heat and relieve strangury can play a good role in regulation. However, dietary contraindication during medication should not be neglected to avoid improper diet affecting the efficacy of the medication. Only comprehensive regulation can restore health.

在中医理论中，肝旺脾虚证常表现为方圆面容与睥虚如球，治疗时应遵循“寒者热之”原则，调理肝脾以恢复平衡。若遇阴茧或悬痈，则需清火解毒，消除体内湿热。悬痈虽病在局部，实则与肝脾功能失调密切相关。通过辨证施治，方能标本兼治，恢复健康。此过程需注重整体观念，调和阴阳，以达到祛病强身之目的。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, the Liver hyperactivity with spleen deficiency pattern often manifests as a square and round facial appearance and non-inflammatory oedema of the eyelid. Treatment should adhere to the principle of "Treat cold with heat," regulating and harmonizing the liver and spleen to restore balance. If encountering vulvar ulceration or perineal abscess, it is necessary to clear heat and remove toxins to eliminate damp-heat within the body. Although perineal abscess is a localized condition, it is closely related to the dysfunction of the liver and spleen. Through pattern identification and treatment, both the tip and root can be addressed, restoring health. This process requires an emphasis on the holistic concept, harmonizing Yin and Yang, to achieve the goal of eliminating disease and strengthening the body.

最近不少朋友反映孩子容易感冒，其实这和“肺开窍于鼻”有关，肺气不足，鼻子自然容易受寒。有些孩子天生体质较弱，可能是“胎传”所致。家长们要注意，孩子如果出现“乳蛾”或“癞头疮”，可能是体内“后天之气”不足，需要及时调整。此外，如果孩子感觉“身重”，可能是因为“大肠液亏证”，导致体内阴阳失衡。平时多注意饮食调理，适当运动，才能有效“调整阴阳”，让孩子远离疾病困扰。||Recently, many friends have reported that their children are prone to the common cold, which is actually related to the concept that "the lung opens into the nose." When lung qi is insufficient, the nose naturally becomes more susceptible to cold. Some children are inherently weaker in constitution, which may be due to "maternal–to–fetal transmission." Parents should be attentive; if children exhibit symptoms of "tonsillitis" or "scalp ringworm," it may indicate a deficiency of "acquired qi" within their bodies, necessitating timely adjustments. Additionally, if a child feels "body heaviness," it might be due to an "intestinal dryness pattern," leading to an imbalance of yin and yang in the body. Paying close attention to dietary regulation and engaging in appropriate physical activities can effectively "regulate and balance yin and yang," helping children stay away from the困扰 of diseases.

Prolonged Spleen Deficiency leads to dysfunction in transportation and transformation, resulting in poor appetite, which in turn affects the generation and transformation of Qi and Blood, forming a weak pulse. If externally affected by wind-cold impediment, it is prone to triggering the Wind Water Pattern, exacerbating the condition. The Running Piglet syndrome is also related to Spleen Deficiency, with Qi movement disorder and ascending along the meridians. Additionally, although warts are skin lesions, their etiology is also inseparable from Spleen Deficiency and dampness accumulation, caused by the combination of internal and external pathogens. Therefore, in treatment, comprehensive consideration should be given to strengthening the Spleen and tonifying Qi, dispelling wind and dissipating cold, and harmonizing the Three Yin and Three Yang, in order to treat both the tip and root effectively.

Prolonged dietary irregularities can easily lead to the formation of "stomach masses due to food retention," affecting digestion and absorption. The unblocking of "the large intestine meridian of hand-Yangming" is greatly beneficial in alleviating such issues. If one feels chest tightness and subcostal pain, it may be a manifestation of the "chest/subcostal stasis pattern," requiring timely regulation. During dry weather, one is susceptible to the "dryness toxin pattern," characterized by dry skin, discomfort in the throat, and even triggering "acute laryngeal obstruction."

The former is often caused by disharmony of the Spleen system and the accumulation of damp evil, while the latter is usually triggered by the flourishing of heat toxin. The liver likes free will and hates to be suppressed, and emotional fluctuations where anger prevails over excessive thinking can exacerbate the condition, affecting the smooth movement of Qi. In treatment, emphasis is placed on removing toxins and resolving swelling, and regulating and harmonizing the liver and spleen to restore the normal skin color at the junction between the red and white skin.

Additionally, "Guest movement" reflects the influence of the natural world on the human body, and "Excessive overthinking damages the spleen" reminds us that emotional factors cannot be overlooked in their impact on the spleen and stomach. For spontaneous sweating due to exterior deficiency, "Formulas that secure the exterior and stop sweating" can effectively regulate the condition. In treatment based on pattern identification, "Patterns of Wei-defense, qi, Ying nutrients and blood" are important classification methods, and "The monarch organ" refers to the heart, emphasizing its dominant role among the Zang-fu organs.

The theory of identical annual congruence emphasizes the man-nature correspondence, which affects the Yin-Yang balance of the human body.

在日常生活中，我们常听说“思伤脾”，情绪波动确实会影响脾胃功能。比如，产后妈妈们因情绪压力大，容易出现“产后缺乳”，这时不妨试试“理气健胃”的食疗方。此外，有些人一到夏天就“畏光”，这可能与“阳维脉”不畅有关。而对于皮肤问题，如“鹅掌风”和“杨梅疮”，中医的“输刺（五刺）”疗法能起到很好的调理作用。总之，中医讲究内外兼修，调理好身体，才能远离这些烦恼。||In daily life, we often hear that "excessive overthinking damages the spleen," and indeed, emotional fluctuations can affect the function of the spleen and stomach. For example, postpartum mothers, due to high emotional stress, are prone to "postpartum oligogalactia," and in such cases, it might be beneficial to try dietary therapy that "circulate qi and harmonize the stomach." Additionally, some people experience "photophobia" as soon as summer arrives, which may be related to the obstruction of the "Yangwei meridian." For skin issues such as "tinea manuum" and "syphilitic skin lesion," the "Shu needling (one of the five needling techniques)" therapy in Traditional Chinese Medicine can play a significant role in regulation. In summary, Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes the importance of both internal and external cultivation; only by properly regulating the body can one stay away from these troubles.

在日常养生中，我们常听到“阳盛阴衰”和“阴虚阳亢”的说法，其实这都是体内阴阳失衡的表现。比如，腋痈和肛裂虽然症状不同，但都可能因胃阳不足或命门火衰引起。尤其要注意的是，心水泛滥也可能导致死脉的出现。保持阴阳平衡，关注胃阳和命门的养护，是预防这些问题的关键。简单的食疗和适当的按摩，都能有效调理，让身体恢复健康。记住，养生贵在坚持，点滴积累才能见成效！||In daily health preservation, we often hear the terms "Yang waxing with yin waning" and "Yin deficiency leading to yang hyperactivity," which are actually manifestations of an imbalance between Yin and Yang within the body. For example, although axillary abscess and anal fissure have different symptoms, they can both be caused by insufficient stomach yang or a decline in the fire of the gate of life. It is particularly important to note that congestive heart failure can also lead to the appearance of a critical pulse. Maintaining a balance between Yin and Yang, and paying attention to the nourishment of stomach yang and the gate of life, are key to preventing these issues. Simple dietary therapy and appropriate tuina can effectively regulate the body, restoring it to health. Remember, the essence of health preservation lies in persistence; only through gradual accumulation can results be seen!

At this time, one should be cautious of "Child’s illness affecting the mother," as disharmony between the spleen and stomach can impact overall health. High temperatures and humid environments easily trigger latent summer heat pestilence, allowing pathogenic summer heat to invade, leading to heat pattern transforming into cold, causing the body to alternate between chills and fever, making it difficult to adapt. Parents should also pay attention to children's wind rashes symptoms and provide timely regulation. Additionally, carbuncle of the heel is a common skin condition in summer; steaming methods can be tried to alleviate pain.

在现代快节奏的生活中，很多人容易出现偏头风，这其实与温补肝阳不足有关。中医认为，营气是维持身体正常运转的重要物质，一旦营气不足，容易引发各种疾病。比如，肾经寒🗎证就是因寒邪侵袭肾经所致，表现为腰膝冷痛。而瘴疟则多见于南方潮湿地区，需特别注意。遇到惊则气乱的情况，情绪波动大会影响气血运行。对于药毒类病，我们要谨慎用药，避免药物副作用。燔针疗法在某些情况下也能起到很好的温经散寒作用。总之，了解这些中医术语，有助于我们更好地调理身体，保持健康。||In the fast-paced modern life, many people are prone to hemilateral head wind, which is actually related to the insufficiency of warm and tonify liver yang. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that ying-nutrient qi is an important substance for maintaining the normal functioning of the body, and once ying-nutrient qi is insufficient, it can easily lead to various diseases. For example, cold dampness in the kidney meridian pattern is caused by the invasion of pathogenic cold into the kidney meridian, manifested as cold pain in the waist and knees. Miasmic malaria is more common in the humid southern regions, requiring special attention. In cases of fright causing the qi to become chaotic, significant emotional fluctuations can affect the flow of qi and blood.

According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, the spleen and stomach are the postnatal foundation and the source of genuine qi. Once there is Yin deficiency with heat in the spleen and stomach, leading to non-inflammatory oedema of the eyelid, the body will issue warnings. In daily diet, attention should be paid to the harmony of the five flavours, especially when the large intestine's function of governing conveyance is compromised, a lighter diet is recommended.
