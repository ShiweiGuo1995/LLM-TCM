Methods: HPLC was used to establish the fingerprint profiles of the traditional decoction and formula granules of Sangju Yin. The differences in chemical composition between the traditional decoction and formula granules of Sangju Yin were analyzed from four aspects: types of chemical components, similarity of fingerprint profiles, chemical pattern recognition analysis, and content of representative indicator components. Results: The similarity of fingerprint profiles of 10 batches of traditional decoction was all >0.988, with 35 characteristic peaks identified, including 12 common peaks (Peak 7: neochlorogenic acid, Peak 10: chlorogenic acid, Peak 11: cryptochlorogenic acid, Peak 13: 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, Peak 17: rutin, Peak 19: forsythoside A, Peak 20: luteoloside, Peak 24: isochlorogenic acid B, Peak 25: 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, Peak 31: forsythin, Peak 32: buddleoside, Peak 35: ammonium glycyrrhizinate). The similarity of fingerprint profiles of formula granules was all >0.983, with 29 characteristic peaks identified. Compared with the traditional decoction, some batches of formula granules lacked peaks 14, 26, 27, 30, 32, and 34. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis could distinguish between the two. The content of indicator components such as neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythoside A, luteoloside, isochlorogenic acid B, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythin, and buddleoside in the traditional decoction was higher than that in the formula granules, while the content of rutin and ammonium glycyrrhizinate in the formula granules was higher than that in the traditional decoction. Conclusion: There are differences in the types and content of components between Sangju Yin formula granules and traditional decoction. The combination of fingerprint profiles and chemical pattern recognition can effectively evaluate the differences between the traditional decoction and formula granules of Sangju Yin, laying a foundation for the quality control and clinical rational application of Sangju Yin formula granules.

Huang Yuanyu's "One Qi Circulation" theory emphasizes the central earth and focuses on the smooth regulation of the overall qi mechanism, which can explain the physiological and pathological conditions of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is related to the dysfunction of the spleen and stomach in the middle burner, the obstruction of qi circulation, and the weakened ability of the body to resist pathogens, leading to abnormal ascending and descending of clear and turbid qi. Based on the "One Qi Circulation" theory combined with the idea of "preventing disease before it occurs," the author proposes prevention and treatment principles for high-risk HPV infection: "Prevent disease before it occurs by regulating the central earth and preserving healthy qi," "Prevent disease progression by balancing ascending and descending to eliminate pathogenic factors," and "Prevent recurrence after recovery by balancing yin and yang and harmonizing qi and blood," aiming to provide references for clinical treatment.

The pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) involves the deficiency of heart qi and heart yang, and the prolonged dysfunction of the triple burner's qi transformation, which progresses from deficiency to a mixed state of deficiency and excess in the later stages. The Linggui Zhugan Decoction (abbreviated as "Linggui Zhugan Tang") exerts its effects through the "four-in-one" approach: its nature is pungent, sweet, and warm, with a mild sweetness and slight bitterness, where the pungent and sweet warmth transforms qi to promote diuresis and supports yang to eliminate fluid retention, while the mild bitterness promotes water drainage and dries dampness, facilitating the water passages; its location is the heart, spleen, and triple burner, which can invigorate heart yang, strengthen the spleen to eliminate fluid retention, and regulate the water passages of the triple burner; its tendency is to act both upwards and downwards, internally and externally, promoting the upper and benefiting the lower, dispersing externally and tonifying internally, thereby facilitating the water passages of the triple burner; its syndrome is the deficiency of heart yang and the flooding of water and phlegm, commonly used in treating cardiac diseases with upward rushing of water qi. The dysfunction of the triple burner and the recurrent episodes of CHF are mutually causative, and the Linggui Zhugan Decoction can warm the fire of the triple burner's qi transformation and clear the pathways of the triple burner's qi transformation, addressing the systemic fluid retention in CHF; its pharmacological effects include anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of myocardial cell membrane ion channels, anti-ischemia-reperfusion injury, and regulation of vascular tone. Deconstructing the Linggui Zhugan Decoction from the "four-in-one" perspective and exploring its mechanism in treating CHF in conjunction with the theory of "triple burner qi transformation" is of significant importance for revitalizing the vitality of classical prescriptions and their precise and effective application.

Compared to internal herbal treatments, external traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies for UP are simpler to administer, act more quickly, and avoid the first-pass effect and potential liver and kidney damage caused by oral medications. These external treatments mainly include herbal washes, medicinal baths, fumigation and washing, wet compresses, enemas, gua sha, acupuncture, auricular acupoint pressing, acupoint application, iontophoresis at acupoints, and autologous blood acupoint injection. Currently, most studies add external TCM therapies to conventional Western medical treatments, which can enhance efficacy and show certain advantages in improving pruritus symptoms, inflammatory markers, sleep quality, and anxiety-depression states. Some studies have selected indicators such as parathyroid hormone, blood phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, and β2-microglobulin to evaluate efficacy, suggesting that external TCM therapies can improve the micro-inflammatory state and protect renal function, although the mechanisms require further research. Existing studies face the following issues: the lack of uniform clinical efficacy evaluation scales makes cross-comparison and summarization difficult; the relief of pruritus symptoms is judged based on scales, which is highly subjective; the treatment courses are short, making it impossible to assess long-term efficacy and safety; some studies do not specify the patient's syndrome type, making it difficult to reflect the advantages of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment. These aspects need to be improved in future research.

通过挖掘醒脑开窍理论的核心思想，分析醒脑开窍理论与中医脑病的关系，探究针灸辨治中医脑病的必要性，以明晰针灸脑病当如何辨证论治。“醒脑开窍”是调神理论的核心，是立足于醒脑、醒神、调神的原则而确立，其调神思想与中医脑病证治密不可分。基于针灸疗法的特色及中医脑病的复杂性和特殊性，针灸治疗脑病理应有其独特的辨证论治体系。针灸实践过程中，中医脑病证治当以“脑”为本，以“醒神调神”为总治则，在“醒脑开窍针法”主穴基础上化裁，针对不同脑病配合相应的治法。||By excavating the core ideas of the theory of awakening the brain and opening the orifices, analyzing the relationship between this theory and brain diseases in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and exploring the necessity of acupuncture in the treatment of TCM brain diseases, this study aims to clarify how acupuncture should be applied in the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases. The concept of "awakening the brain and opening the orifices" is central to the theory of regulating the spirit, established on the principles of awakening the brain, awakening the spirit, and regulating the spirit. Its spirit-regulating ideology is closely intertwined with the treatment of brain diseases in TCM. Given the unique characteristics of acupuncture therapy and the complexity and specificity of brain diseases in TCM, acupuncture treatment for brain diseases should have its own unique system of syndrome differentiation and treatment. In the practice of acupuncture, the treatment of brain diseases in TCM should be based on the "brain," with "awakening and regulating the spirit" as the general treatment principle. It should adapt the main points of the "awakening the brain and opening the orifices acupuncture method" and combine it with corresponding treatment methods for different brain diseases.

糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）为糖尿病常见慢性并发症，可导致足部溃疡、坏疽，严重者可导致截肢，影响患者生活质量。DPN属中医“痹病”“痿病”等范畴，主要病机为气血阴阳亏虚，痰浊瘀血痹阻脉络，临床以气虚血瘀证多见。本文基于《黄帝内经》“气脉常通”理论，提出DPN气虚血瘀证患者的治疗应以“益气活血、化瘀通痹”为原则，使患者气脉通达，延缓疾病进展，为DPN的中医治疗提供参考。||Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes, which can lead to foot ulcers, gangrene, and in severe cases, amputation, affecting the quality of life of patients. DPN falls under the categories of "Bi disease" and "Wei disease" in traditional Chinese medicine, with the main pathogenesis being deficiency of Qi, blood, Yin, and Yang, and obstruction of meridians by phlegm and blood stasis. Clinically, the syndrome of Qi deficiency and blood stasis is commonly seen. Based on the theory of "unobstructed Qi and meridians" from the "Huangdi Neijing," this article proposes that the treatment of DPN patients with Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome should follow the principle of "tonifying Qi, activating blood, resolving stasis, and unblocking Bi," to ensure the unobstructed flow of Qi and meridians, delay disease progression, and provide a reference for the traditional Chinese medicine treatment of DPN.

Its core pathogenesis involves the disorder of qi and blood, damage to the heart and spirit, dysfunction in ascending and descending, and stagnation of the pivotal axis. Treatment should focus on regulating the ascending and descending of qi and blood, aiming to replenish qi and activate blood circulation, and to regulate the ascending and descending functions. In replenishing qi and activating blood circulation, priority should be given to replenishing qi, and blood-activating drugs should be appropriately selected according to the degree of blood stasis to ensure smooth blood flow and support the spirit. Regulating the ascending and descending functions should focus on adjusting the liver's ascending and the lung's descending, as well as the spleen and stomach. Attention should be paid to the ascending, descending, floating, and sinking properties of the drugs, aligning with the physiological functions of the organs, and restoring the ascending and descending movements of the organ qi.

Currently, there is no clear solution to the reproductive damage caused by Tripterygium wilfordii. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii is due to its bitter, cold, and cool nature, which can dry liver blood, damage liver yang, deplete kidney essence, and harm kidney yang when used for a long time, disrupting the balance of qi, blood, yin, and yang in the organs, leading to infertility. Based on the connection between the liver and kidney and human reproductive function, this article proposes understanding the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii from the perspective of "Yi Gui Tong Yuan" (liver and kidney sharing the same origin) and explores methods to reduce the reproductive toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii according to the concept of "simultaneous treatment of liver and kidney," aiming to expand the theoretical thinking of traditional Chinese medicine for safe clinical application.

Methods: Clinical research literature on TCM treatment of SAP from the establishment of the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, and SinoMed until February 28, 2022, was searched. The frequency statistics, cluster analysis, and association rule analysis of TCM data were performed using Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, and SPSS Statistics 22.0 software to summarize the core prescriptions. Results: A total of 289 prescriptions involving 185 TCM herbs and 38 TCM syndrome types were included. Based on the overall study of SAP as a "disease", it was found that clinical treatment of SAP mainly involves blood-activating and stasis-resolving drugs, deficiency-tonifying and body-strengthening drugs, and qi-regulating and phlegm-resolving drugs. The frequently used TCM herbs include Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong), Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), Gancao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), Huangqi (Astragalus membranaceus), and Danggui (Angelica sinensis). Commonly used herb pairs include Chuanxiong-Danggui, Chuanxiong-Honghua (Carthamus tinctorius), and Chuanxiong-Zhishi (Citrus aurantium). The complex network diagram and cluster analysis of drugs showed that the modified Buyang Huanwu Decoction is the basic prescription for treating SAP. Based on the study of SAP as a "syndrome", it was found that qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, phlegm and blood stasis syndrome, and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome are the more common TCM syndrome types of SAP, all of which are mainly treated with warm and neutral drugs; the flavors of the drugs are mainly sweet, pungent, and bitter, and they mostly belong to the liver, spleen, lung, and heart meridians. Among them, the qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome is treated with the Buyang Huanwu Decoction composed of high-frequency drugs such as Huangqi, Chuanxiong, and Danshen; the phlegm and blood stasis syndrome is often treated with the Gualou Xiebai Banxia Decoction combined with Taohong Siwu Decoction composed of high-frequency drugs such as Banxia (Pinellia ternata), Chuanxiong, and Xiebai (Allium macrostemon); the qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome is treated with the Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction composed of high-frequency drugs such as Chuanxiong, Danggui, and Zhiqiao (Citrus aurantium). The cluster analysis of drugs for qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome can be divided into 3 categories, and the phlegm and blood stasis syndrome can be divided into 4 categories. Conclusion: Deficiency, stasis, phlegm, and stagnation are important pathological factors of SAP, among which qi deficiency is the basis of the disease, blood stasis runs through the disease, and it may be accompanied by phlegm turbidity and qi stagnation syndrome. Focusing on the pathogenesis of root deficiency and branch excess, clinical treatment often involves tonifying deficiency and activating blood circulation and removing stasis, with syndrome differentiation and prescription selection.

基于络病理论，认为邪侵肺络，癌毒内蕴，逐渐形成“瘀络”“盛络”“虚络”等络脉病变，与肿瘤细胞形成的异常血管网络较为相似，可分别演变为缺氧、炎症、免疫抑制性的肿瘤微环境，影响肺癌的治疗效果。结合肿瘤生物学特性，基于叶天士“络以通为用”观点，可相应运用化瘀通络、解毒通络、益气通络之法，活用化瘀、解毒与扶正药物，靶向调节缺氧环境、炎症状态和免疫反应，有助于诱导肿瘤血管正常化，重塑肿瘤微环境，在提高联合治疗疗效的同时，也可减轻不良反应、提高患者耐受性。||Based on the theory of collateral disease, it is believed that pathogenic factors invade the lung collaterals, and cancer toxins accumulate internally, gradually forming collateral lesions such as "stasis collaterals," "exuberant collaterals," and "deficient collaterals," which are quite similar to the abnormal vascular networks formed by tumor cells. These can evolve into hypoxic, inflammatory, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, affecting the treatment efficacy of lung cancer. Combining the biological characteristics of tumors and based on Ye Tianshi's viewpoint that "collaterals should be treated by promoting their patency," methods such as resolving stasis and unblocking collaterals, detoxifying and unblocking collaterals, and supplementing qi and unblocking collaterals can be applied accordingly. By flexibly using stasis-resolving, detoxifying, and qi-tonifying drugs, targeted regulation of the hypoxic environment, inflammatory state, and immune response can be achieved, which helps induce tumor vascular normalization and reshape the tumor microenvironment. This not only enhances the efficacy of combination therapy but also reduces adverse reactions and improves patient tolerance.

中风软瘫以中风后患者身体运动功能异常，肌肉张力下降为主要表现，是中风后较为常见的病理状态，软瘫时间越长预后越差。中医理论认为，中风主因“虚、风、火、痰、瘀、气”而发病，当邪气搏结、阻于经络则使气血凝滞、经筋损伤、肌肉痿废，导致中风软瘫，因此需立以通经柔筋为其主要治法。火针治疗中风软瘫具有通经温阳、柔筋止痛的作用，可温阳散寒、充养经脉经气、松解筋脉结节、推动气血运行、濡养四肢百骸。火针疗法可促进神经通路的恢复，加强局部新陈代谢，改善局部肌张力，从而恢复肢体功能。火针治疗中风后软瘫的高质量临床研究、选穴规律、规范化操作手法等有待进一步深化。||Stroke-induced flaccid paralysis is primarily characterized by abnormal motor function and decreased muscle tone in patients after a stroke, representing a common pathological state post-stroke. The longer the duration of flaccid paralysis, the worse the prognosis. Traditional Chinese Medicine theory posits that stroke is mainly caused by "deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, stasis, and qi." When pathogenic factors accumulate and block the meridians, it leads to stagnation of qi and blood, damage to the sinew channels, and muscle atrophy, resulting in stroke-induced flaccid paralysis. Therefore, the primary treatment approach should focus on unblocking the meridians and softening the sinews. Fire needle therapy for stroke-induced flaccid paralysis has the effects of unblocking meridians, warming yang, softening sinews, and relieving pain. It can warm yang to dispel cold, nourish the meridians and qi, loosen sinew nodules, promote the circulation of qi and blood, and nourish the limbs and body. Fire needle therapy can promote the recovery of neural pathways, enhance local metabolism, improve local muscle tone, and thereby restore limb function. High-quality clinical research on fire needle therapy for post-stroke flaccid paralysis, the rules for acupoint selection, and standardized operational techniques require further in-depth study.

This approach involves inheriting and innovating the academic thought of Mr. Pu Fuzhou, which emphasizes "smoothing qi and blood, and valuing the ascent and descent," as well as the "harmony and unity thought" of Master Xue Boshou. Starting from the essence of dual-heart disharmony, the core treatment method focuses on "regulating qi and blood together, and ascending the clear while descending the turbid." In regulating qi and blood, treatment should vary according to deficiency and excess. If deficiency is predominant, it is necessary to combine tonification and regulation to adjust qi and blood, commonly using Shuanghe Powder. If excess is predominant, a combination of movement and stillness is needed to smooth the blood vessels, commonly using Huangqi Chifeng Decoction and Yueju Pill. In ascending the clear and descending the turbid, it is essential to harmonize the qi mechanism and balance tonification and purgation, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate qi and relieve depression, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to tonify qi and ascend the clear, and Zhizhu Decoction or Zhizhu Pill to purge turbidity and expel impurities.

The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution of the population prone to colorectal polyps is often related to dampness. Pathological changes that easily trigger colorectal polyps, such as intestinal flora imbalance, intestinal micro-inflammatory state, neuro-endocrine-immune network abnormalities, and aquaporin abnormalities, are consistent with modern research findings on the mechanisms of dampness. It is believed that factors such as improper diet and emotional distress lead to spleen deficiency and dampness accumulation, with various pathogenic factors intertwining to form tangible foreign bodies, which is the TCM pathogenesis of dampness-induced colorectal polyps. Based on the pathogenic characteristics of dampness and the contributing factors of colorectal polyps, this study explores the influence of dampness in the onset of colorectal polyps, aiming to provide an effective TCM theoretical basis for the integrated diagnosis and treatment of colorectal polyps in clinical practice.

The concept first appeared in the "Taiping Shenghui Fang" and is derived from the "Lingshu·Yuban" section on "Adverse and Favorable Conditions." Over the centuries, various interpretations and adaptations of the Five Favorable Signs and Seven Adverse Signs have emerged. By reviewing historical medical texts, it is evident that there are two main versions of this theory: one from the "Taiping Shenghui Fang" and its derivatives (such as the Five Favorable Signs and Seven Adverse Signs for smallpox and measles, and the Rescue Methods for Five Favorable Signs and Seven Adverse Signs), and the other from the "Waike Zhengzong" and its derivatives.

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。||A systematic review of the Longdan Xiegan Tang in ancient medical texts reveals that the original formulation in "Lan Shi Mi Cang" primarily targeted male genital odor. Through modifications by Xue Ji, its therapeutic scope gradually expanded, leading to confusion in the formula's name, composition, and origins, particularly evident in "Jingyue Quanshu" and "Yifang Jijie." Historically, interpretations of this formula have focused on the viscera and bowels. However, a reinterpretation from the perspective of meridians may offer a better understanding of its therapeutic principles. By attributing genital disorders to the Liver Meridian of Foot-Jueyin and symptoms like hypochondriac pain and deafness to the Gallbladder Meridian of Foot-Shaoyang, and adjusting the medication based on the condition, it not only facilitates a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the formula for precise clinical diagnosis and treatment but also prompts modern researchers to reconsider the significant role of meridian theory in the formation and development of the entire theoretical system of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

《本草纲目》作为明代代表性本草著作，书中所附植物图像以另一种形式保留了李时珍对药材基原植物的考证结果，真实反映了明代对药物与植物的认识与利用情况。以书中木部香木类植物图像为例，通过考证图像所绘植物基原，以揭示明代对植物知识与药物性质的认识水平。木部香木类所载的 25 幅图像中，20 幅图像准确描述了植物的叶花及果实等，杉图对植物三尖杉形态细节的表述等均证明了明代对植物形态与药物性质认识处于较高水平。但乌药、阿魏等共 5 图的错误也说明明代对植物形态的认识仍有局限之处。通过图像考证结果与文字所载药性对比可知，明代对药性的了解程度已然鞭辟着里，对部分植物的药性认识甚至高于对其形态的了解。||The "Compendium of Materia Medica," as a representative herbal text of the Ming Dynasty, preserves Li Shizhen's research on the original plants of medicinal materials through the plant images attached in the book, truly reflecting the understanding and utilization of drugs and plants during the Ming Dynasty. Taking the images of aromatic wood plants in the wood section of the book as an example, by investigating the original plants depicted in the images, the level of understanding of plant knowledge and medicinal properties in the Ming Dynasty is revealed. Among the 25 images of aromatic wood plants in the wood section, 20 accurately describe the leaves, flowers, and fruits of the plants. The detailed depiction of the morphology of the three-pointed fir in the fir image, among others, demonstrates the high level of understanding of plant morphology and medicinal properties during the Ming Dynasty. However, errors in the images of five plants, including Lindera aggregata and Ferula, indicate that there were still limitations in the understanding of plant morphology during that period. By comparing the results of image research with the medicinal properties recorded in the text, it is evident that the Ming Dynasty had a profound understanding of medicinal properties, with knowledge of the medicinal properties of some plants even surpassing their understanding of the plants' morphology.

通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。||By analyzing the relevant unearthed documents and the provisions of the transmitted texts, this study deciphers the treatment details of "stone carbuncle" in the "Inverse and Sequential Five-Colored Pulse Zang Examination of the Spirit" from the "Tianhui Medical Bamboo Slips," elucidating its connection with the theories of transmitted medical classics. Compared to the stone treatment methods in the "Mai Fa" from Mawangdui and the "Mai Shu" from Zhangjiashan, the "stone spirit" method for treating carbuncles in the "Tianhui Medical Bamboo Slips" is applied before the blood accumulation and pus formation of carbuncles, preventing the progression of the condition and achieving a "definite cure" effect. Additionally, the diagnostic and treatment methods related to stone carbuncles may have inspired the later concepts of "regulating the spirit" and the theory of preventive medicine to some extent.

《伤寒类证便览》是明新安医家陆彦功编集整理的一部伤寒类医籍，计 12 卷，初刊于明弘治十二年（1499）。国内外现存有 3 种版本：一种为藏于日本内阁文库全本和辽宁中医药大学图书馆藏的残本，两地藏本均为婺源汪范依据陆氏保和堂于明弘治十二年刊本进行缮写翻刻的刻本，刊刻时间不详，原保和堂弘治十二年刊本未见；一种为藏于四川省图书馆的所谓“明弘治刻本”；一种为藏于上海中医药大学图书馆的清代精抄本。其文献来源主要有《伤寒类证》《注解伤寒论》《伤寒明理论》《活人书》《太平惠民和剂局方》《此事难知》《伤寒图歌活人指掌》《胎产药方》《小儿伤寒药方》。该书使已经亡佚的《伤寒类证》得以较完整地流传下来。||"Shanghan Leizheng Bianlan" is a medical text on typhoid fever compiled and organized by Lu Yangong, a physician from Xin'an during the Ming Dynasty, consisting of 12 volumes, first published in the 12th year of the Hongzhi era (1499). There are currently three extant versions: one is a complete copy held in the Japanese Cabinet Library and a fragmentary copy in the Library of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, both of which are transcriptions and reprints based on the Hongzhi 12th year edition of Lu's Baohetang, with the exact reprint date unknown, and the original Baohetang edition from Hongzhi 12th year is not seen; another is the so-called "Hongzhi edition of the Ming Dynasty" held in the Sichuan Provincial Library; and the third is a finely copied manuscript from the Qing Dynasty held in the Library of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The sources of the text mainly include "Shanghan Leizheng," "Annotations on the Treatise on Cold Damage," "Shanghan Mingli Lun," "Huo Ren Shu," "Taiping Huimin Heji Jufang," "Ci Shi Nan Zhi," "Shanghan Tuge Huoren Zhizhang," "Taichan Yaofang," and "Xiao'er Shanghan Yaofang." This book has allowed the otherwise lost "Shanghan Leizheng" to be relatively completely preserved and passed down.
