Methods The fingerprints of traditional decoction and medicinal granules of Sangju drink were established using HPLC method. The differences in chemical composition between traditional decoction and medicinal granules were analyzed from four aspects: types of chemical components, similarity of fingerprint maps, chemical pattern recognition analysis, and content of representative index components. Results The similarity of fingerprint maps of 10 batches of traditional decoction was all >0.988, identifying 35 characteristic peaks, of which 12 shared peaks were identified (peak 7 is neochlorogenic acid, peak 10 is chlorogenic acid, peak 11 is cryptochlorogenic acid, peak 13 is 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, peak 17 is rutin, peak 19 is forsythoside A, peak 20 is luteolin glycoside, peak 24 is isochlorogenic acid B, peak 25 is 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, peak 31 is forsythoside B, peak 32 is linarin, peak 35 is ammonium glycyrrhizinate); the similarity of fingerprint maps of medicinal granules was all >0.983, identifying 29 characteristic peaks. Compared with traditional decoction, some batches of medicinal granules lack peaks 14, 26, 27, 30, 32, and 34. Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis can distinguish the two. The contents of index components such as neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythoside A, astragaloside, isochlorogenic acid B, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, forsythoside B, and linarin in traditional decoction are higher than those in medicinal granules, while the contents of rutin and ammonium glycyrrhizinate in medicinal granules are higher than those in traditional decoction. Conclusion There are differences in component types and contents between medicinal granules and traditional decoction of Sangju drink. The combination of fingerprint map and chemical pattern recognition can effectively evaluate the differences between traditional decoction and medicinal granules of Sangju drink, laying the foundation for quality control of medicinal granules of Sangju drink and their clinical rational application.

Huang Yuanyu's theory of "Qi movement in one qi" emphasizes the central earth and focuses on the smooth flow of overall qi, which can explain the physiology and pathology of women. The occurrence of high-risk HPV infection is associated with the dysfunction of spleen earth in the middle jiao leading to unsmooth flow of qi, low ability of the body to resist evil influences, and abnormal rising and falling of clear and turbid substances. Based on the theory of "Qi movement in one qi" combined with the idea of "preventing a disease before it arises," the author proposes the principles of "preventing a disease before it arises by smoothing the central earth to preserve healthy qi," "preventing transmission of a disease after its onset by promoting rising and falling to eliminate toxic pathogens," and "after recovery, preventing recurrence by balancing yin and yang and harmonizing qi and blood" for the prevention and treatment of high-risk HPV infection, aiming to provide reference for clinical treatment.

Fuling Guizhi Baishu Gancao Decoction (referred to as "Linggui Zhugan Decoction") exerts its effects through "nature, position, momentum, and pattern": its nature is pungent-sweet and warm, bland-sweet with a hint of bitterness; pungent-sweet warmth facilitates Qi transformation and diuresis, supports Yang and eliminates fluid; bland-bitterness promotes diuresis and dries dampness, and facilitates water channels; its position is Heart, Spleen, and Sanjiao, it can invigorate Heart Yang, strengthen the Spleen to eliminate phlegm-fluid, and regulate water passages of Sanjiao; its momentum is simultaneous action above and below, internal and external regulation, promoting urination from above and benefiting urination below, announcing externally and replenishing internally, thus facilitating the water passages of Sanjiao through momentum; its pattern is deficiency of Heart Yang and proliferation of fluid and phlegm-fluid, often used in treating heart diseases caused by upward surging water Qi. Dysfunction of Sanjiao and recurrent episodes of CHF are interdependent causes and results; Linggui Zhugan Decoction can warm the fire of Sanjiao Qi transformation and facilitate the pathways of Sanjiao Qi transformation, playing a role in addressing systemic fluid retention in CHF; its pharmacological actions include anti-inflammation, anti-platelet aggregation, regulation of myocardial cell membrane ion channels, anti-ischemia reperfusion injury, and regulation of vascular tone.

Methods The medical cases from the chapters on "Phlegm-Fluid Retention," "Phlegm Asthma," and "Liver Wind Phlegm Fire" in Wang Xugao's clinical case records were used to establish a database. All Chinese herbal medicines were analyzed for frequency and properties using Excel 2017 software. For those with a frequency ≥10, association rule analysis based on the Apriori algorithm was conducted using IBM SPSS Modeler 18 software, and cluster analysis based on the Ochiai algorithm was performed using SPSS 25.0 software. Results A total of 80 medical cases involving 114 prescriptions and 191 types of Chinese herbal medicines were included. The frequently used herbs mainly included Poria (Fuling), Pinellia (Banxia), Citrus Peel (Chenpi), White Atractylodes (Baizhu), and Bitter Apricot Kernel (Kuxingren). The medicinal properties of Wang Xugao’s prescriptions were primarily warm, followed by cold and neutral; the predominant flavors were sweet, bitter, and pungent; and the primary meridians were Lung, Spleen, Stomach, Liver, and Kidney. The association rule analysis identified core herb pairs such as Winter Heliotrope (Kuan Dong Hua) - Bitter Apricot Kernel (Xing Ren), Pinellia (Banxia) - Dried Ginger (Gan Jiang), and Uncaria (Gouteng) - Oyster Shell (Shijueming). Cluster analysis yielded 8 core drug combinations. Conclusion When treating phlegm-fluid retention, Wang Xugao emphasized the simultaneous treatment of multiple zang-fu organs to coordinate their balance, attaching importance to the complexity of causative factors involving cold, fire, and dampness. He focused on supporting healthy qi to expel pathogenic qi and regulating the Sanjiao to smooth the Qi movement. Treatment methods often involved simultaneous treatment of the three jiao, warming Yang to transform phlegm, and clearing Liver to subdue wind, using sweet-warm medicines with an auxiliary role of bitter-pungent medicines.

尿毒症瘙痒（UP）是终末期肾脏病患者常见并发症，严重降低患者生活质量。中医外治法治疗 UP 相较于中药内治法操作简便、起效迅速，且能避免口服药物所致首关效应及可能带来肝肾损伤，治疗手段主要包括中药外洗、药浴、熏洗、湿敷、灌肠、刮痧、针刺、耳穴贴压、穴位敷贴、穴位离子导入、自体血穴位注射等。目前，多数研究在西医常规治疗基础上加用中医外治法，可提高疗效，在改善瘙痒症状、炎症指标、睡眠质量及焦虑抑郁状态等方面具有一定优势；一些研究选取甲状旁腺激素、血磷、CRP、IL-6、组胺、SCr、BUN、β2-微球蛋白等指标评价疗效，结果提示中医外治法可改善患者微炎症状态，保护肾功能，但其作用机制有待进一步研究。现有研究存在以下问题：临床疗效评价量表不统一，难以横向比较和总结；瘙痒症状的缓解依据量表评判，主观性较强；研究疗程较短，无法评判远期疗效和安全性；部分研究未指明患者证型，难以体现中医辨证论治优势等，今后还需完善。||Uremia pruritus (UP) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease, significantly reducing their quality of life. Traditional Chinese external therapy for UP is operationally simple, rapidly effective, and can avoid the first-pass effect caused by oral medication as well as potential liver and kidney damage. The main treatment methods include external washing with Chinese herbal medicines, bathing, fumigation and washing, wet compress, enema, Gua Sha, acupuncture, ear point pressure, acupoint application, acupoint iontophoresis, and autologous blood injection at acupoints. Currently, most studies add traditional Chinese external therapy on the basis of conventional Western medicine treatment, which can improve therapeutic effects, showing certain advantages in improving pruritus symptoms, inflammatory indicators, sleep quality, and anxiety-depression status; some studies use indicators such as parathyroid hormone, serum phosphorus, CRP, IL-6, histamine, SCr, BUN, and β2-microglobulin to evaluate efficacy, suggesting that traditional Chinese external therapy can improve micro-inflammatory state and protect renal function, but its mechanism of action needs further study. Existing studies have the following problems: there is no unified evaluation scale for clinical efficacy, making it difficult to compare and summarize horizontally; relief of pruritus symptoms relies heavily on rating scales, making it more subjective; the course of treatment is relatively short, making it impossible to judge long-term efficacy and safety; some studies do not specify patient patterns, making it difficult to demonstrate the advantages of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, etc. In the future, improvements are still needed.

糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）为糖尿病常见慢性并发症，可导致足部溃疡、坏疽，严重者可导致截肢，影响患者生活质量。DPN属中医“痹病”“痿病”等范畴，主要病机为气血阴阳亏虚，痰浊瘀血痹阻脉络，临床以气虚血瘀证多见。本文基于《黄帝内经》“气脉常通”理论，提出DPN气虚血瘀证患者的治疗应以“益气活血、化瘀通痹”为原则，使患者气脉通达，延缓疾病进展，为DPN的中医治疗提供参考。||Diabetes peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes, which can lead to foot ulcers, gangrene, and in severe cases, amputation, thereby affecting the patient's quality of life. DPN falls under the scope of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as "Bi disease" and "Wei disease," with the main pathogenesis being deficiency of Qi-Yang and Blood-Yin, phlegm turbidity and stagnant blood obstructing the vessels, and clinical manifestations predominantly showing patterns of Qi deficiency and blood stasis. Based on the theory of "Qi and vessels are always unobstructed" from the Huangdi Neijing, this paper proposes that for patients with DPN who present with Qi deficiency and blood stasis, treatment should follow the principle of "tonifying Qi and promoting blood circulation, resolving stagnant blood and relieving impediments," enabling the patient's Qi and vessels to be unblocked, thus delaying disease progression. This provides a reference for the TCM treatment of DPN.

Its core pathogenesis is disharmony of Qi and Blood, damage to the Spirit, disorder of ascending and descending movements, and stagnation of the pivotal function. Treatment should focus on regulating both ascending and descending movements of Qi and Blood. The treatment principle involves tonifying Qi and activating Blood, and adjusting ascending and descending functions. Tonifying Qi and activating Blood should prioritize tonifying Qi first, and appropriately select Blood-stasis resolving herbs based on the degree of Blood stasis, ensuring smooth circulation of Blood and providing a foundation for the Spirit; Adjusting ascending and descending functions should emphasize regulating the liver's ascending and lung's descending functions as well as the spleen and stomach, paying attention to the ascending, descending, floating, and sinking properties of the herbs, in accordance with the physiological functions of the zang-fu organs, to restore the ascending and descending movements of Qi within the zang-fu organs.

Methods Clinical research literature on TCM treatment of SAP from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, and SinoMed system up to February 28, 2022 were retrieved. The software used for analysis included Clementine 12.0, Excel 2016, and SPSS Statistics 22.0, which were employed for frequency statistics, cluster analysis, and association rule analysis of Chinese medicine data to summarize core prescriptions. Results A total of 289 prescriptions involving 185 types of Chinese medicines and covering 38 TCM syndromes were included. Based on the overall study of SAP "disease," the main drugs used in clinical treatment of SAP include blood-activating and stasis-resolving herbs, tonifying and reinforcing herbs, and qi-regulating and phlegm-transforming herbs. Commonly used Chinese medicines include Chuanxiong, Danshen, Glycyrrhiza, Astragalus, and Angelica; commonly used drug pairs include Chuanxiong-Angelica, Chuanxiong-Carthamus, and Chuanxiong-Zhi Shi. The complex network diagram of drugs and cluster analysis show that the modified Bazhen Decoction is the basic formula for treating SAP. Based on the study of SAP "syndrome," Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, phlegm and blood stasis intertwined syndrome, and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome are relatively common TCM syndromes in SAP, with all three mainly using warm and neutral properties; the taste is mainly sweet, pungent, and bitter, and they often belong to the liver, spleen, lung, and heart meridians. Among them, for Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, the modified Bazhen Decoction composed of high-frequency drugs such as Astragalus, Chuanxiong, and Danshen is the basic formula; for phlegm and blood stasis intertwined syndrome, the commonly used basic formula is usually composed of high-frequency drugs such as processed Pinellia, Chuanxiong, and Allium macrostemon combined with Tao Hong Siwu Decoction; for qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome, the basic formula is usually composed of high-frequency drugs such as Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Citrus aurantium shell. Drug cluster analysis shows that Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome and qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome can be divided into 3 categories, while phlegm and blood stasis intertwined syndrome can be divided into 4 categories. Conclusion Deficiency, stasis, phlegm, and stagnation are important pathogenic factors in SAP, among which Qi deficiency is the foundation of disease onset, and blood stasis runs through the entire disease process, possibly accompanied by phlegm-dampness and qi stagnation. Based on the pathogenesis of fundamental deficiency and superficial excess, clinical treatment often focuses on tonic medicines and blood-activating and stasis-resolving medicines, with syndrome differentiation for prescription selection.

基于络病理论，认为邪侵肺络，癌毒内蕴，逐渐形成“瘀络”“盛络”“虚络”等络脉病变，与肿瘤细胞形成的异常血管网络较为相似，可分别演变为缺氧、炎症、免疫抑制性的肿瘤微环境，影响肺癌的治疗效果。结合肿瘤生物学特性，基于叶天士“络以通为用”观点，可相应运用化瘀通络、解毒通络、益气通络之法，活用化瘀、解毒与扶正药物，靶向调节缺氧环境、炎症状态和免疫反应，有助于诱导肿瘤血管正常化，重塑肿瘤微环境，在提高联合治疗疗效的同时，也可减轻不良反应、提高患者耐受性。||Based on the theory of collateral diseases, it is considered that evil invades the lung collaterals, cancer toxins accumulate internally, gradually forming "stasis collaterals," "excess collaterals," and "deficient collaterals" among collateral vessel lesions, which are quite similar to the abnormal vascular networks formed by tumor cells. These can respectively evolve into hypoxic, inflammatory, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, affecting the therapeutic effects of lung cancer. Combining with the biological characteristics of tumors, based on Ye Tianshi's view that "collaterals function through unimpeded flow," corresponding methods such as transforming stasis and unblocking collaterals, detoxifying and unblocking collaterals, and tonifying qi and unblocking collaterals can be applied. Flexible use of drugs for resolving stasis, detoxifying, and reinforcing can target the regulation of hypoxic environment, inflammatory state, and immune response, which helps induce normalization of tumor vasculature, reshape the tumor microenvironment, improve the efficacy of combined treatment, alleviate adverse reactions, and enhance patient tolerance.

The longer the duration of soft paralysis, the worse the prognosis. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, wind stroke primarily results from "deficiency, wind, fire, phlegm, blood stasis, and qi stagnation." When pathogenic qi binds and obstructs the meridians, it leads to stagnation of qi and blood, damage to the twelve muscle regions, and atrophy of muscles, causing wind stroke soft paralysis. Therefore, the main treatment method should focus on unblocking the meridians and softening the tendons. Fire needling therapy has the effect of unblocking the meridians, strengthening yang, and softening the tendons to relieve pain. It can warm yang, dispel cold, nourish the qi of meridians, release the knots of the tendons, promote the circulation of qi and blood, and moisten the limbs and all body parts. Fire needling therapy can promote the recovery of nerve pathways, enhance local metabolism, improve local muscle tone, and thus restore limb function. High-quality clinical studies on fire needling for treating soft paralysis after wind stroke, selection patterns, and standardized operational techniques require further in-depth research.

In harmonizing qi and blood, one should differentiate treatment based on deficiency and excess; if deficiency predominates, body and function should be combined to tonify qi and blood, often using Shuanghe Powder; if excess predominates, dynamic and static methods should be combined to unblock the vessels, commonly using Huangqi Chifeng Decoction and Yueju Pill. For promoting clarity and reducing turbidity, one should regulate qi movement and appropriately combine tonification and purgation, commonly using Shengjiang Powder to regulate qi and resolve depression, Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to tonify qi and promote clarity, and Zhizhu Decoction or Zhizhu Pills to purge turbidity and remove filth.

The constitution of people prone to colorectal polyps is often associated with dampness in traditional Chinese medicine. Dysbiosis of intestinal flora, micro-inflammation state in the intestine, abnormalities in the neuro-endocrine-immune network, and aquaporin anomalies, which can easily lead to colorectal polyps, are consistent with the modern mechanisms of dampness. It is considered that dietary indiscretion and emotional stagnation lead to spleen deficiency and dampness accumulation, and various pathogenic factors intertwine to form tangible foreign bodies, which is the pathogenesis of dampness causing colorectal polyps in traditional Chinese medicine.

五善七恶是一种判断中医外科疾病预后的理论，被诸多中医古籍提及，为历代外科医家重视，但现代文献对其论述较少。五善七恶首见于《太平圣惠方》，其理论源自《灵枢·玉版》中的“逆顺”。五善七恶经过历代医家的发挥，衍生出诸多变体。通过梳理历代医籍对五善七恶的记载，发现主要版本有两大类：一是《太平圣惠方》版及其衍生版（痘疹五善七恶、五善七恶救援法等）；二是《外科正宗》版及其衍生版。||Five Good Signs and Seven Unfavorable Signs is a theory used to judge the prognosis of traditional Chinese surgical diseases, mentioned in many ancient Chinese medical texts and valued by generations of surgeons. However, modern literature discusses this less frequently. The Five Good Signs and Seven Unfavorable Signs first appeared in "Taiping Holy Benevolent Formula", with its theory originating from the "Inverse and Sequential" in "Ling Shu Jade Edition". Through the development by generations of physicians, many variants have emerged. By reviewing the records of Five Good Signs and Seven Unfavorable Signs in historical medical texts, it was found that there are mainly two major versions: one version is the "Taiping Holy Benevolent Formula" edition and its derivatives (smallpox five good signs and seven unfavorable signs, rescue method for five good signs and seven unfavorable signs, etc.); the other version is the "Authentic Treatise on Surgery" edition and its derivatives.

系统梳理历代医书中的龙胆泻肝汤发现，最初《兰室秘藏》所载龙胆泻肝汤主要针对男子前阴臊臭之疾，经过薛己的加减变化使主治范围逐渐泛化扩展，并出现方剂名称、组成和源流混乱的问题， 《景岳全书》和《医方集解》在这一问题上表现得较为突出。过往医家多从脏腑角度对该方进行解读，转换视角从经脉角度重新解读，或可更好理解龙胆泻肝汤的主治规律。将前阴的病症归于足厥阴肝经，而将胁痛、耳聋等病症归于足少阳胆经，并根据病情加减用药，既有利于对该方全面与深入的理解以实现临床辨证与用药精准，也可促使现代研究者重新思考经络学说在整个中医理论体系的形成与发展过程中起到的重要作用。||A systematic review of Longdan Xiegan Decoction recorded in medical books throughout history reveals that the original formula in "Lanshi Mise" mainly targeted diseases of the male anterior yin with a foul odor. After modifications by Xue Ji, the scope of its main indications gradually expanded, leading to confusion regarding the names, compositions, and origins of the formula. This issue was particularly prominent in "Jingyue Quanshu" and "Yifang Jijie." Previous medical practitioners often interpreted this formula from the perspective of zang-fu organs; however, shifting the perspective to meridians and reinterpreting it might better elucidate the rules governing the main indications of Longdan Xiegan Decoction. The conditions of the anterior yin can be attributed to the liver meridian of foot-jueyin, while conditions such as pain in the subcostal region and deafness can be attributed to the gallbladder meridian of foot-shaoyang. Adjusting the medication according to the condition not only facilitates a comprehensive and profound understanding of the formula for accurate clinical pattern identification and medication but also prompts modern researchers to reconsider the crucial role of meridians and collaterals in the formation and development of the entire theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine.

《本草纲目》作为明代代表性本草著作，书中所附植物图像以另一种形式保留了李时珍对药材基原植物的考证结果，真实反映了明代对药物与植物的认识与利用情况。以书中木部香木类植物图像为例，通过考证图像所绘植物基原，以揭示明代对植物知识与药物性质的认识水平。木部香木类所载的 25 幅图像中，20 幅图像准确描述了植物的叶花及果实等，杉图对植物三尖杉形态细节的表述等均证明了明代对植物形态与药物性质认识处于较高水平。但乌药、阿魏等共 5 图的错误也说明明代对植物形态的认识仍有局限之处。通过图像考证结果与文字所载药性对比可知，明代对药性的了解程度已然鞭辟着里，对部分植物的药性认识甚至高于对其形态的了解。||Compendium of Materia Medica, as a representative herbal monograph of the Ming Dynasty, retains in another form Li Shizhen's identification results of medicinal original plants through the plant images attached in the book, truly reflecting the understanding and utilization of drugs and plants during the Ming Dynasty. Taking the plant images of the fragrant wood category in the woody section of the book as an example, by examining the original plants depicted in the images, it reveals the level of understanding of plant knowledge and drug properties in the Ming Dynasty. Among the 25 images recorded in the fragrant wood category of the woody section, 20 images accurately describe the leaves, flowers, and fruits of the plants, and the expression of the three-needle fir's morphological details and others all prove that the Ming Dynasty had a high level of understanding of plant morphology and drug properties. However, the errors in the 5 images, such as those of Lindera aggregata and Ferula, also indicate that there were still limitations in the understanding of plant morphology during the Ming Dynasty. By comparing the results of image examination with the drug properties recorded in the text, it can be known that the understanding of drug properties in the Ming Dynasty was already quite thorough, and the understanding of the properties of some plants even exceeded their understanding of morphology.

通过对读相关出土文献与传世文献条文，解析《天回医简》中《逆顺五色脉臧验精神》中“石疽。太上石神，石神必已；其次石血，石血得分；其下石脓，石脓十一活”的治法细节，阐发其与传世医经理论的关联。相比马王堆《脉法》与张家山《脉书》中的砭石治法，《天回医简》中治疗痈疽的“石神”之法，用在痈疽血聚、脓成之前，可防止痈疽的病情发展并达到“必已”的疗效。另外，石疽相关的诊疗方法可能在一定程度上启发了后世的“调神”思想及治未病理论。||By comparing and interpreting the relevant provisions of the unearthed documents and existing literature, this study analyzes the treatment details of "Shi Ju. Tai Shang Shi Shen, Shi Shen Bi Yi; Qi Xia Shi Xue, Shi Xue Fen De; Qi Xia Shi Nong, Shi Nong Shi Yi Sheng" in the "Reversal and Sequence of Five Colors and Vessels Inspection of Spirit and Essence" chapter of the "Medical Texts from Tianhui" and elucidates its connection with the theories of existing medical classics. Compared to the stone needle treatments described in the "Pulse Methods" from Mawangdui and the "Pulse Texts" from Zhangjiashan, the "Shi Shen" method for treating carbuncles and boils in the "Medical Texts from Tianhui" can be applied before the formation of blood stasis and pus, thereby preventing the progression of the disease and achieving the therapeutic effect of "Bi Yi". Additionally, the diagnostic and therapeutic methods related to stone carbuncle may have inspired subsequent thoughts on regulating the spirit and the theory of preventing diseases before they arise.

《伤寒类证便览》是明新安医家陆彦功编集整理的一部伤寒类医籍，计 12 卷，初刊于明弘治十二年（1499）。国内外现存有 3 种版本：一种为藏于日本内阁文库全本和辽宁中医药大学图书馆藏的残本，两地藏本均为婺源汪范依据陆氏保和堂于明弘治十二年刊本进行缮写翻刻的刻本，刊刻时间不详，原保和堂弘治十二年刊本未见；一种为藏于四川省图书馆的所谓“明弘治刻本”；一种为藏于上海中医药大学图书馆的清代精抄本。其文献来源主要有《伤寒类证》《注解伤寒论》《伤寒明理论》《活人书》《太平惠民和剂局方》《此事难知》《伤寒图歌活人指掌》《胎产药方》《小儿伤寒药方》。该书使已经亡佚的《伤寒类证》得以较完整地流传下来。||"Shanghan Leizheng Bianlan" is a Shanghan-related medical text compiled and organized by Lu Yangong, a doctor from Xin'an in the Ming Dynasty. It consists of 12 volumes and was first published in the 12th year of Hongzhi during the Ming Dynasty (1499). There are currently three existing versions domestically and internationally: one version is kept in the Cabinet Library of Japan in its entirety and a damaged copy in the Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine library; both versions were copied and engraved based on the original Hongzhi 12th year edition published by Lu's Baohetang, but the exact engraving time is unknown, and the original Baohetang Hongzhi 12th year edition has not been seen; another version is referred to as the "Hongzhi carved edition of the Ming Dynasty" and is kept in the Sichuan Provincial Library; the last version is a Qing Dynasty fine manuscript kept in the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine library. The main sources of its literature include "Shanghan Leizheng", "Annotations to Shanghan Lun", "Minglilun of Shanghan", "Shi Ren Shu", "Taiping Hui Min Heji Jufang", "Nan Zhi Nan Zhi", "Hutu Huoge Huoren Zhibang", "Fayaofang", "Xiaoer Shanghan Yaofang". This book has made it possible for the already lost "Shanghan Leizheng" to be relatively completely passed down.
