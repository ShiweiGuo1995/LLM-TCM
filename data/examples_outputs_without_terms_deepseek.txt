最近天气转凉，不少朋友反映早上起床时总是感觉口干舌燥，甚至出现口齿病类的症状，比如牙龈肿痛、口腔溃疡等。中医认为，这可能是体内“阳”气不足，导致“悬饮”内停，影响了津液的正常分布。特别是那些经常熬夜的朋友，更容易出现“五更泄泻”的情况，早上天还没亮就急着跑厕所。对于小朋友来说，秋冬季节还要警惕“小儿天花”这类传染病的侵袭，家长们要注意给孩子保暖，避免受凉。如果孩子鼻塞严重，可以试试“通鼻”的小妙招，比如用温热的毛巾敷鼻子，或者按摩迎香穴。此外，饮食上也要注意调理，避免过食寒凉，尤其是“下消”体质的朋友，更要少吃生冷食物，以免加重“筋疝”等问题。总之，秋冬养生要顺应自然规律，内外兼修，才能健康过冬！||Recently, the weather has turned cooler, and many friends have reported feeling dry and parched upon waking up in the morning, even experiencing symptoms such as swollen gums and mouth ulcers. Traditional Chinese Medicine suggests that this may be due to insufficient "yang" energy in the body, leading to the stagnation of "suspended fluid," which affects the normal distribution of body fluids. Especially for those who often stay up late, they are more prone to experiencing "early morning diarrhea," rushing to the bathroom before dawn. For children, the autumn and winter seasons also require vigilance against infectious diseases like "smallpox," and parents should pay attention to keeping their children warm to avoid catching a cold. If a child has severe nasal congestion, they can try some small tricks to "clear the nose," such as applying a warm towel to the nose or massaging the Yingxiang acupoint. Additionally, dietary adjustments are also important, avoiding excessive consumption of cold and raw foods, especially for those with a "lower consumption" constitution, to prevent aggravating issues like "hernia." In summary, maintaining health in autumn and winter requires following natural laws and balancing internal and external practices to stay healthy through the winter!

在中医理论中，"脉从四时"强调了人体脉象随季节变化而调整的重要性，体现了天人相应的整体观念。对于"火形人"而言，由于其体质偏热，易出现"齿漏"、"胆瘅"等症状，因此在治疗上常采用"发散风寒药"以调和内外。同时，"沉肩坠肘"不仅是太极拳中的基本要领，也是中医养生中调节气血流通的重要方法。此外，"补益精髓"对于维护"肾阴"的平衡至关重要，肾阴充足则能有效预防多种疾病，促进健康长寿。这些中医术语和实践方法共同构成了中医养生和治疗的重要组成部分。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "pulse following the four seasons" emphasizes the importance of adjusting the body's pulse according to seasonal changes, reflecting the holistic concept of harmony between humans and nature. For individuals with a "fire constitution," who tend to have a hot body type and are prone to symptoms such as "tooth leakage" and "gallbladder heat," treatments often involve "dispelling wind-cold herbs" to harmonize the internal and external. Additionally, "sinking the shoulders and dropping the elbows" is not only a fundamental principle in Tai Chi but also an important method in TCM health preservation for regulating the flow of qi and blood. Furthermore, "tonifying the essence and marrow" is crucial for maintaining the balance of "kidney yin," as sufficient kidney yin can effectively prevent various diseases and promote health and longevity. These TCM terms and practices collectively form an essential part of TCM health preservation and treatment.

在中医理论中，难产常与血寒证及血虚风燥证相关联，这些证候可能导致孕妇气血运行不畅，进而影响分娩过程。手少阳三焦经证则涉及体内水液代谢的调节，其失调可能加剧身肢放长的症状，影响孕妇的体态和分娩能力。中土常守的概念强调了脾胃功能的重要性，脾胃虚弱可能使孕妇更易受到中毒及意外伤害类的影响。两感则是指内外邪气同时侵袭，这在孕妇中可能导致复杂的病理变化，增加难产的风险。因此，中医在治疗难产时，常综合考虑这些证候，通过调理气血、强化脾胃功能及调节三焦经来达到治疗目的。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, difficult labor is often associated with blood cold syndrome and blood deficiency with wind-dryness syndrome, which may lead to poor circulation of qi and blood in pregnant women, thereby affecting the delivery process. The syndrome of the Triple Burner Meridian of Hand Shaoyang involves the regulation of body fluid metabolism, and its dysfunction may exacerbate symptoms of body elongation, affecting the posture and delivery ability of pregnant women. The concept of the middle earth often guarding emphasizes the importance of spleen and stomach functions, and weakness in these organs may make pregnant women more susceptible to poisoning and accidental injuries. Dual affliction refers to the simultaneous invasion of internal and external pathogenic factors, which in pregnant women may lead to complex pathological changes and increase the risk of difficult labor. Therefore, in treating difficult labor, traditional Chinese medicine often considers these syndromes comprehensively, aiming to regulate qi and blood, strengthen spleen and stomach functions, and regulate the Triple Burner Meridian to achieve therapeutic goals.

最近有朋友问我，面色苍白、食欲不振怎么办？这让我想到了中医里的“补脾健胃”理念。脾虚胃弱，确实容易导致面色苍白、消化不良。中医讲究“酸甘化阴”，像山楂、乌梅这些酸味食物，搭配甘味的红枣、蜂蜜，既能开胃又能滋阴。如果体内湿气重，还可以考虑用“逐水剂”来调理。不过，如果出现“肉瘿”这类问题，还是要及时就医。另外，情绪对身体的影响也不容忽视，“情志相胜法”告诉我们，保持心情舒畅对健康至关重要。像“风毒炽盛证”这种急性病症，更要及时处理，避免病情加重。总之，养生要从日常饮食、情绪调节入手，才能让“水轮”运转顺畅，身体自然健康！||Recently, a friend asked me what to do about a pale complexion and poor appetite. This reminded me of the concept of "tonifying the spleen and strengthening the stomach" in traditional Chinese medicine. A weak spleen and stomach can indeed lead to a pale complexion and indigestion. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "sour and sweet flavors transforming yin," so sour foods like hawthorn and dark plum, paired with sweet foods like red dates and honey, can both stimulate the appetite and nourish yin. If there is excessive dampness in the body, one might consider using "dampness-expelling agents" for regulation. However, if issues like "meaty goiter" arise, it is important to seek medical attention promptly. Additionally, the impact of emotions on the body should not be overlooked. The "method of emotional regulation" teaches us that maintaining a cheerful mood is crucial for health. Acute conditions like "wind-toxin exuberance syndrome" require timely treatment to prevent worsening. In summary, maintaining health should start with daily diet and emotional regulation, ensuring the smooth functioning of the "water wheel" and naturally leading to a healthy body!

在中医理论中，"虚者补其母"是一种重要的治疗原则，强调通过补益母脏来调治子脏的虚弱状态。例如，对于因脾胃虚弱导致的"目瞤"（眼睑跳动），可通过补益脾胃来缓解症状。此外，"攻下药"在治疗实证便秘中发挥重要作用，而"祛瘀生新"则常用于处理因血瘀引起的"无头疖"等皮肤问题。在针灸治疗中，"郄穴"作为特定穴位，常用于急性疼痛的缓解。值得注意的是，某些特殊病症如"臭田螺"（一种皮肤感染）和"思证"（因思虑过度引发的病症）在临床上也需要特别关注。这些中医理论和实践方法体现了中医整体观念和辨证论治的特点。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "treating deficiency by nourishing the mother" is an important therapeutic principle, emphasizing the regulation of the deficient state of the child organ by tonifying the mother organ. For example, for "eye twitching" (eyelid twitching) caused by spleen and stomach deficiency, symptoms can be alleviated by tonifying the spleen and stomach. Additionally, "purgative drugs" play a significant role in treating constipation due to excess, while "removing stasis to generate new tissue" is commonly used to address skin issues such as "headless boils" caused by blood stasis. In acupuncture treatment, "Xi-cleft points" as specific acupoints are often used for the relief of acute pain. It is noteworthy that certain special conditions such as "stinky snail" (a type of skin infection) and "thought syndrome" (illness caused by excessive thinking) also require special attention in clinical practice. These theories and practical methods of traditional Chinese medicine reflect the holistic concept and the characteristics of syndrome differentiation and treatment in TCM.

在中医理论中，"下法"是一种重要的治疗方法，主要用于通过促进排泄来清除体内的病邪。例如，对于"足阳明胃经"相关的疾病，如"火淫证"，下法可以有效缓解症状。此外，"肝肾阴虚证"和"痰气郁结证"也是常见的病理状态，前者表现为阴虚火旺，后者则与气机郁滞有关。在治疗这些证型时，中医强调调和阴阳，疏通气机。对于孕妇，"止血安胎"是治疗中的重要原则，旨在保护胎儿和母体健康。在诊断过程中，观察舌象如"滑苔"可以提供重要的病理信息。中医认为，人体各器官如"相傅之官"般协同工作，维持生命活动的平衡。通过综合运用这些理论和方法，中医能够有效地治疗和预防多种疾病。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, the "purgation method" is an important treatment approach, primarily used to eliminate pathogenic factors from the body by promoting excretion. For example, for diseases related to the "Stomach Meridian of Foot Yangming," such as "fire excess syndrome," the purgation method can effectively alleviate symptoms. Additionally, "liver-kidney yin deficiency syndrome" and "phlegm-qi stagnation syndrome" are common pathological states, with the former manifesting as yin deficiency with fire excess and the latter related to qi stagnation. In treating these syndromes, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes harmonizing yin and yang and promoting the flow of qi. For pregnant women, "stopping bleeding and calming the fetus" is an important principle in treatment, aimed at protecting the health of both the fetus and the mother. During the diagnostic process, observing tongue signs such as "slippery coating" can provide crucial pathological information. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the organs of the human body work together like "officials in a court," maintaining the balance of life activities. By comprehensively applying these theories and methods, traditional Chinese medicine can effectively treat and prevent various diseases.

Kidney deficiency and cold syndrome often manifests as soreness and weakness in the lower back and knees, cold intolerance, and cold limbs, with insufficient primordial yang being its core pathogenesis. Practicing Tai Chi can warm and tonify kidney yang, improve the circulation of primary qi, and alleviate symptoms caused by blood stasis blocking the essence chamber, such as male infertility or sexual dysfunction. Additionally, the breathing regulation in Tai Chi helps improve gynecological issues like amenorrhea by promoting the flow of qi and blood and harmonizing the functions of the internal organs. For patients with alopecia, the relaxing effects of Tai Chi can relieve mental stress, indirectly improving hair loss symptoms. The concept of "unblocking meridians and activating collaterals" emphasized in the treatment of abscesses and ulcers aligns with the principles of Tai Chi movement, and the combination of the two can further enhance therapeutic efficacy.

最近很多朋友问我，为什么总是感觉手脚冰凉，晚上还容易手足抽掣，这其实可能是心肾阳虚证的表现。中医讲究常色，如果你的面色偏白，加上手足抽掣，那就要注意了。心水不足，经气不畅，都会导致这种情况。特别是五十动之后，身体的阴阳气血津液精髓证类容易出现失衡，这时候调理就显得尤为重要。平时可以多吃一些温补的食物，避免疳气的侵袭，保持心情舒畅，才能让身体的气血运行更加顺畅。||Recently, many friends have asked me why they often feel cold hands and feet and are prone to cramps at night. This could actually be a manifestation of heart and kidney yang deficiency syndrome. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes normal complexion; if your face is pale and you experience cramps in your hands and feet, you should pay attention. Insufficient heart water and poor circulation of meridian qi can lead to this condition. Especially after the age of fifty, the body's yin, yang, qi, blood, body fluids, and essence are prone to imbalance, making it particularly important to regulate the body at this time.

Phlegm-heat disturbing the heart syndrome is mainly characterized by excessive heart fire and internal disturbance of phlegm-heat, leading to mental restlessness, and the treatment should focus on clearing heat, resolving phlegm, and calming the mind. Red-thread furuncle is often caused by dysfunction of the liver's ascending and dispersing functions, leading to qi stagnation and blood stasis, and the treatment requires soothing the liver, regulating qi, and activating blood circulation to remove stasis. In addition, small intestine deficiency-cold syndrome is also common in clinical practice, manifesting as abdominal pain and diarrhea, and the treatment should warm the middle, dispel cold, and strengthen the spleen and stomach. The theory of mutual restraint among the five elements points out that dysfunction of the zang-fu organs can influence each other, such as liver wood overacting on spleen earth, leading to dysfunction of the granary official, imbalance of qi's ability to control fluids, and thus affecting water metabolism. In summary, classical formula treatment should comprehensively consider the functions of the zang-fu organs and the relationships of mutual generation and restraint among the five elements to achieve the goal of holistic regulation.

最近有朋友问我，为什么总是感觉眼睛干涩，晚上还容易失眠。其实这跟“肝开窍于目”和“肝藏魂”有很大关系。肝气不畅，眼睛就容易出问题，而肝藏魂的功能失调，也会影响睡眠质量。另外，有些人手指出现“梭状指”，这可能是“赤虫病”的表现，需要及时调理。还有朋友提到自己舌苔发黄，这可能是“真苔”的表现，说明体内有湿热。如果出现“膀胱蓄血证”，可能会伴随尿频、尿痛等症状，这时候需要“清泻虚热”来调理。总之，身体的每一个小信号都可能是某种疾病的提示，大家一定要重视起来！||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel their eyes are dry and they easily suffer from insomnia at night. In fact, this is closely related to the concept that "the liver opens into the eyes" and "the liver stores the soul." If liver qi is not flowing smoothly, the eyes are prone to problems, and dysfunction in the liver's role of storing the soul can also affect sleep quality. Additionally, some people may notice "spindle-shaped fingers," which could be a sign of "schistosomiasis" and requires timely treatment. Another friend mentioned having a yellow tongue coating, which might indicate "true coating," suggesting the presence of damp-heat in the body. If symptoms of "bladder blood stasis syndrome" appear, such as frequent urination and painful urination, it is necessary to "clear and drain deficient heat" for treatment. In summary, every small signal from the body could be a hint of some disease, and it is important to take these signs seriously!

By observing changes in the pulse, one can determine the state of cold or heat within the patient's body. For example, patients with blood heat often exhibit a rapid and strong pulse, while those with cold syndrome show a deep and slow pulse. Additionally, symptoms of alternating cold and heat are often identified through pulse diagnosis. In terms of treatment, the pricking and cupping method is commonly used for patients with blood heat, regulating the heat pathogen in the body through bloodletting. In posture adjustment, arching the back and tucking the buttocks, as well as spreading the buttocks, are two common methods to improve the flow of qi and blood.

This reminds me of the saying in traditional Chinese medicine, "The liver's brilliance is in the nails." When liver qi is insufficient, nails tend to turn white and become brittle. If you also experience symptoms of qi deficiency and blood stasis, such as pale complexion and easy fatigue, it's important to pay attention to regulation. Wind-cold bi syndrome is also a common ailment in autumn and winter, especially among the elderly. It's advisable to eat more warming and nourishing foods, such as red dates and longan, to help replenish qi and promote bowel movements. If symptoms of wind-heat and toxic heat syndrome appear, such as dry mouth and constipation, you can try heat-clearing and detoxifying dietary remedies, such as mung bean soup. Friends with sun-stored blood syndrome should pay attention to keeping warm and avoid catching cold. In summary, health maintenance in autumn and winter should be tailored to the individual, and symptomatic regulation can achieve twice the result with half the effort!

最近在门诊遇到不少家长反映孩子出现小儿厌食的情况，这让我想起了中医里常说的胃气亏虚证。其实，孩子的脾胃功能尚未发育完全，很容易受到外界影响。如果再加上饮食不规律，就容易导致胃气亏虚，进而引发厌食。中医讲究行气降逆，通过调理气机来改善症状。此外，有些女性朋友可能会遇到倒经的问题，这其实与阳盛阴衰有关，体内的阴阳失衡会导致月经不调。还有肾风，虽然听起来陌生，但它与肾虚密切相关，尤其是现代人熬夜、压力大，容易伤肾。总之，无论是小儿厌食还是倒经、肾风，中医都有其独特的调理方法，关键是要找到病因，对症下药。||Recently, many parents have reported cases of childhood anorexia in outpatient clinics, which reminds me of the syndrome of stomach qi deficiency often mentioned in traditional Chinese medicine. In fact, children's spleen and stomach functions are not fully developed and are easily affected by external factors. If coupled with irregular eating habits, it can easily lead to stomach qi deficiency, which in turn causes anorexia. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes the regulation of qi to alleviate symptoms. Additionally, some women may experience inverted menstruation, which is related to excessive yang and deficient yin, leading to menstrual irregularities due to the imbalance of yin and yang in the body. There is also kidney wind, which, although it may sound unfamiliar, is closely related to kidney deficiency, especially among modern people who stay up late and are under high stress, making them prone to kidney damage. In summary, whether it is childhood anorexia, inverted menstruation, or kidney wind, traditional Chinese medicine has its unique methods of regulation, with the key being to identify the cause and treat accordingly.

在中医理论中，"客邪"是指外来的致病因素，如风寒湿邪等，常导致多种疾病。例如，"口糜"和"喉癣"便是由客邪侵袭口腔和咽喉部位引起的常见病症，表现为口腔黏膜的炎症和咽喉部的癣状病变。此外，"顽癣"和"臀红"也是由客邪引起的皮肤病，前者指顽固性的皮肤癣症，后者则是臀部皮肤的红肿现象。在治疗这些疾病时，中医常采用"闪罐法"，通过快速拔罐来驱散体内的邪气。同时，中医还强调"五轮"理论，即五脏与五官的对应关系，认为肾主水，与"肾风"相关，肾风可导致耳鸣、头晕等症状。因此，治疗时需综合考虑内外因素，以达到最佳疗效。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "external pathogens" refer to external pathogenic factors such as wind, cold, and dampness, which often lead to various diseases. For example, "oral erosion" and "throat ringworm" are common conditions caused by the invasion of external pathogens into the oral cavity and throat, manifesting as inflammation of the oral mucosa and ringworm-like lesions in the throat. Additionally, "stubborn ringworm" and "buttock redness" are skin diseases caused by external pathogens, with the former referring to persistent skin ringworm and the latter being redness and swelling of the skin on the buttocks. In treating these diseases, traditional Chinese medicine often employs the "flash cupping method," which involves rapid cupping to disperse pathogenic qi from the body. At the same time, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes the "five wheels" theory, which is the correspondence between the five internal organs and the five sense organs, believing that the kidneys govern water and are related to "kidney wind," which can cause symptoms such as tinnitus and dizziness. Therefore, treatment requires a comprehensive consideration of internal and external factors to achieve the best therapeutic effect.

最近有朋友问我，总是感觉身体疲惫，精神不集中，甚至有时候会“失神”，这到底是怎么回事呢？其实，这可能是身体的气机不畅，导致“行气降逆”功能失调。中医讲究“开吸合呼”，通过调整呼吸来调节气机，帮助身体恢复平衡。如果你还伴有“经行口糜”或者“小肠泌别清浊”功能不佳，可以试试一些“祛🗎化痰”的食疗方，比如梨汤或者百合粥。此外，如果出汗过多，可以考虑使用“固表止汗剂”来帮助收敛汗液，保护“腠理”。希望这些小建议能帮到你，记得保持良好的生活习惯哦！||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel physically exhausted, mentally unfocused, and sometimes even "spaced out." Actually, this might be due to the body's qi mechanism not flowing smoothly, leading to a dysfunction in "moving qi downward and counteracting adverse qi." Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "inhaling to open and exhaling to close," adjusting breathing to regulate the qi mechanism and help the body regain balance. If you also experience symptoms like "oral ulcers during menstruation" or poor "small intestine function in separating the clear from the turbid," you might try some dietary remedies for "removing phlegm and resolving dampness," such as pear soup or lily porridge.

The lungs govern the skin and hair, and external pathogens can easily invade the body through the skin. If you also have symptoms like coughing and excessive phlegm, it might be due to phlegm obstruction. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that spleen and stomach qi stagnation can also lead to these issues, especially in people with irregular diets and significant emotional fluctuations. For regulation, you can try methods to resolve phlegm and break up stagnation, such as using yin-nourishing ingredients like lily bulbs and white fungus, along with herbs that promote blood circulation and qi movement, such as angelica root and chuanxiong, to help restore the body's balance. If the condition is long-term and recurrent, it might be necessary to consider the possibility of a Jueyin disease pattern, and it is recommended to consult a professional TCM practitioner for syndrome differentiation and treatment.

最近有不少朋友问我关于“遗精”的问题，其实这在中医里很常见，尤其是“肝旺脾虚证”的朋友更容易出现这种情况。中医认为，遗精多与肾虚、心火亢盛有关，而“肝旺脾虚证”则会导致体内“津”液失调，进一步加重症状。调理时，除了注意饮食清淡、避免熬夜，还可以试试“毫针刺法”，通过刺激特定穴位来平衡体内的气血运行。另外，像“百合病”这种以阴虚为主的病症，也容易引发遗精，建议多吃些滋阴润燥的食物。如果伴有“青盲”或“血分证”的症状，比如视力模糊、面色苍白等，可能需要结合“利水消肿”的方法来调理，帮助身体排出多余的水湿。总之，遗精并不可怕，关键是对症调理，慢慢恢复身体的平衡。||Recently, many friends have asked me about "nocturnal emission," which is actually quite common in traditional Chinese medicine, especially among those with "liver excess and spleen deficiency syndrome." Traditional Chinese medicine believes that nocturnal emission is often related to kidney deficiency and excessive heart fire, while "liver excess and spleen deficiency syndrome" can lead to an imbalance of body fluids, further exacerbating the symptoms. For regulation, in addition to maintaining a light diet and avoiding staying up late, you can also try "filiform needle acupuncture," which stimulates specific acupoints to balance the flow of qi and blood in the body. Additionally, conditions like "lily disease," which is primarily characterized by yin deficiency, can also easily trigger nocturnal emission. It is recommended to consume more foods that nourish yin and moisten dryness. If accompanied by symptoms of "green blindness" or "blood syndrome," such as blurred vision and pale complexion, it may be necessary to incorporate methods that promote diuresis and reduce swelling to help the body expel excess dampness. In summary, nocturnal emission is not something to fear; the key is to address the symptoms and gradually restore the body's balance.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了身痛、黄汗的症状，这可能是脾主运化的功能失调所致。中医讲究“泻南补北”，通过调理脾胃来固表敛汗，缓解不适。牢脉的出现往往提示体内有寒湿滞留，而肾消则可能与长期疲劳有关。对于女性朋友，止血安胎的药材如艾叶、阿胶等，可以在医生指导下适量使用，帮助调理身体。总之，养生要顺应自然，内外兼修，才能保持健康。||The weather has been unpredictable lately, leading many people to experience body aches and yellow sweating, which may be due to a dysfunction in the spleen's role of transportation and transformation. Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes "draining the south and supplementing the north," suggesting that regulating the spleen and stomach can help consolidate the exterior and reduce sweating, thereby alleviating discomfort. The appearance of a firm pulse often indicates the retention of cold and dampness in the body, while kidney consumption may be related to prolonged fatigue. For female friends, medicinal herbs that stop bleeding and calm the fetus, such as mugwort and donkey-hide gelatin, can be used in moderation under the guidance of a doctor to help regulate the body. In summary, maintaining health requires adapting to nature and cultivating both internal and external well-being.

最近有朋友问我，为什么总是感觉胸闷气短，我建议他去看看中医。中医讲究“舍症从脉”，通过“单按”寸脉，可以初步判断身体状况。如果寸脉浮而有力，可能是“内发丹毒”或“宣肺祛痰”不足所致。中医治疗讲究“理气导滞”，通过调理气机，疏通经络，可以有效缓解症状。当然，中医诊断不仅仅是“临时诊断用症候术语”，还需要结合整体情况，避免“怪脉”干扰。希望大家在日常生活中多关注自己的身体信号，及时调理，保持健康。||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel chest tightness and shortness of breath. I suggested they consult a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioner. TCM emphasizes "abandoning symptoms to follow the pulse," and by palpating the cun pulse, one can preliminarily assess the body's condition. If the cun pulse is floating and strong, it might be due to "internal erysipelas" or insufficient "lung dispersion and phlegm elimination." TCM treatment focuses on "regulating qi and resolving stagnation," and by adjusting the qi mechanism and unblocking meridians, symptoms can be effectively alleviated. Of course, TCM diagnosis is not just about "using symptomatic terms for temporary diagnosis," but also requires considering the overall situation to avoid interference from "abnormal pulses."

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了臀红、🗎伤脾阳证等症状，这其实与肺合皮毛的理论密切相关。中医讲究急方治急病，对于这些突发的症状，我们可以通过贯顶的方法来缓解。特别是对于失荣、乳疽等较为严重的病症，更需要及时调理。此外，花柳毒淋这类病症虽然不常见，但也需要引起重视。在日常生活中，我们可以通过一些简单的中医方法来预防和缓解这些不适，保持身体的平衡与健康。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many people have experienced symptoms such as red buttocks and spleen yang deficiency syndrome, which are closely related to the theory of the lungs being connected to the skin. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes treating acute illnesses with urgent methods. For these sudden symptoms, we can alleviate them through the method of "Guan Ding." Especially for more severe conditions like loss of vitality and breast abscesses, timely regulation is crucial. Additionally, although conditions like syphilitic strangury are not common, they still require attention. In daily life, we can prevent and alleviate these discomforts through simple traditional Chinese medicine methods to maintain the body's balance and health.

在中医理论中，脏腑辨证是诊断疾病的重要方法，通过分析脏腑功能失调来指导治疗。例如，肝主谋虑，肝气郁结常导致情绪不稳，进而影响全身健康。黄肿病和烂喉痧是常见的疾病，前者多因湿热内蕴，后者则与风热邪毒有关。治疗上，利水渗剂常用于排除体内湿邪，而浓缩丸则因其高效便捷被广泛应用于多种病症。此外，痹症和齿槽风也是临床上常见的疾病，痹症多因风寒湿邪侵袭，导致关节疼痛，齿槽风则与口腔卫生不良密切相关。通过综合运用这些治疗方法，可以有效缓解症状，恢复健康。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, organ pattern differentiation is an important method for diagnosing diseases, guiding treatment by analyzing the dysfunction of internal organs. For example, the liver governs planning, and liver qi stagnation often leads to emotional instability, which in turn affects overall health. Jaundice and scarlet fever are common diseases; the former is mostly caused by internal damp-heat, while the latter is related to wind-heat pathogens. In treatment, diuretic and damp-expelling agents are often used to eliminate dampness from the body, and concentrated pills are widely used for various conditions due to their efficiency and convenience. Additionally, arthralgia and alveolar abscess are also common clinical diseases; arthralgia is mostly caused by the invasion of wind, cold, and dampness, leading to joint pain, while alveolar abscess is closely related to poor oral hygiene. By comprehensively applying these treatment methods, symptoms can be effectively alleviated and health restored.

在中医治疗中，"分经论治"是一种重要的诊疗方法，它强调根据经络的分布和功能来辨证施治。例如，在处理"痧胀"这类疾病时，医生可能会采用"齐刺"技术，即在同一穴位上进行多次针刺，以增强治疗效果。此外，中医理论中的"母病及子"原则指出，母脏的疾病可能会影响到子脏，因此在治疗时需考虑"母气"的调理。对于"热痢"等热性疾病，中医常采用"先补后攻"的策略，即先通过补益药物增强患者体质，再进行清热解毒的治疗。同时，药物的"四性"（寒、热、温、凉）也是选择治疗方案时不可忽视的因素，以确保治疗的安全性和有效性。||In traditional Chinese medicine treatment, "differentiation of meridians for treatment" is an important diagnostic and therapeutic method, emphasizing the differentiation and treatment based on the distribution and function of meridians. For example, when dealing with diseases like "sha zhang," doctors may use the "qi ci" technique, which involves multiple needle insertions at the same acupuncture point to enhance the therapeutic effect. Additionally, the principle of "mother disease affecting the child" in TCM theory indicates that diseases of the mother organ may affect the child organ, thus requiring consideration of the regulation of "mother qi" during treatment. For febrile diseases such as "heat dysentery," TCM often adopts the strategy of "tonifying before attacking," which means first strengthening the patient's constitution with tonifying herbs before proceeding with heat-clearing and detoxifying treatments. Meanwhile, the "four natures" (cold, hot, warm, cool) of medicinal substances are also crucial factors in selecting treatment plans to ensure safety and efficacy.

在中医理论中，小便不禁常与阴虚火旺相关，表现为肾阴不足导致虚火上炎，进而影响膀胱功能。治疗上，可采用炒制药材如炒黄柏以清热燥湿，或使用薄贴外敷以温肾固涩。对于阳明腑证，其症状多与肠胃湿热有关，需清热利湿。精浊则指精液异常，常与肾虚相关，治疗需补肾固精。骨作为肾之府，其健康与肾气密切相关，太平车等传统疗法可通过按摩骨缝以调和气血，促进肾气恢复。综合运用这些方法，可有效改善相关症状，恢复机体平衡。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, urinary incontinence is often associated with yin deficiency and excessive fire, manifested as kidney yin deficiency leading to flaring of deficient fire, which in turn affects bladder function. In treatment, fried medicinal materials such as fried phellodendron can be used to clear heat and dry dampness, or thin plasters can be applied externally to warm the kidneys and consolidate astringency. For Yangming fu syndrome, the symptoms are mostly related to damp-heat in the stomach and intestines, requiring heat-clearing and dampness-draining. Turbid essence refers to abnormal semen, often related to kidney deficiency, and treatment requires tonifying the kidneys and consolidating essence. The bones, as the residence of the kidneys, are closely related to kidney qi, and traditional therapies such as Taiping Che can harmonize qi and blood by massaging the bone sutures to promote the recovery of kidney qi. Comprehensive application of these methods can effectively improve related symptoms and restore the body's balance.

在中医理论中，痰湿是常见的病理产物，其生成与“生痰之源”密切相关，尤其是肝阳上亢时，易导致痰湿内生。针对痰湿阻滞，中医常用“祛痰化湿开窍”之法，通过药物或手法如“太极推手”来疏通经络，促进气血运行。对于痰湿严重者，可选用“涌吐剂”以迅速排除体内痰浊。在药物剂型上，“蜜丸”因其缓释作用，常用于调和药性，适用于慢性痰湿病症。此外，脉象中的“洪脉”常提示体内有热或痰湿壅盛，需结合“痰阻胞宫证”等具体证候进行辨证施治。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, phlegm-dampness is a common pathological product, closely related to the "source of phlegm production," especially when liver yang is hyperactive, it easily leads to internal phlegm-dampness. For phlegm-dampness obstruction, traditional Chinese medicine often uses the method of "dispelling phlegm, resolving dampness, and opening the orifices," through medication or techniques such as "Tai Chi pushing hands" to unblock meridians and promote the circulation of qi and blood. For those with severe phlegm-dampness, "emetics" can be used to quickly expel phlegm turbidity from the body. In terms of drug dosage forms, "honey pills" are often used to harmonize the medicinal properties due to their slow-release effect, suitable for chronic phlegm-dampness conditions. Additionally, the "surging pulse" in pulse diagnosis often indicates heat or excessive phlegm-dampness in the body, requiring differentiation and treatment based on specific syndromes such as "phlegm obstructing the uterine chamber syndrome."

在中医理论中，"阳微阴弦"常被视为体内阴阳失衡的表现，这种状态往往与"饮食不洁"或"养生"不当有关。针对此类症状，中医推崇"补益精髓"的治疗原则，通过调整饮食和生活习惯来恢复体内的阴阳平衡。此外，"热阻痹证"和"红蝴蝶疮"等病症，常采用"消导法"进行治疗，以疏通经络、调和气血。在中医的"十二支"理论中，每个时辰对应不同的脏腑功能，合理安排作息时间，有助于预防和治疗上述疾病，从而达到养生的目的。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "yang deficiency and yin excess" is often regarded as a manifestation of the imbalance of yin and yang within the body, a condition frequently associated with "unclean diet" or improper "health maintenance." For such symptoms, traditional Chinese medicine advocates the treatment principle of "nourishing the essence and marrow," aiming to restore the balance of yin and yang by adjusting diet and lifestyle habits. Additionally, conditions such as "heat obstruction syndrome" and "red butterfly sore" are often treated with the "clearing and guiding method" to unblock meridians and harmonize qi and blood. In the "twelve branches" theory of traditional Chinese medicine, each time period corresponds to different organ functions, and a well-arranged daily routine helps in preventing and treating the aforementioned diseases, thereby achieving the goal of health maintenance.

最近天气变化无常，很多朋友都感觉身体不适，尤其是那些有“气滞水停证”的朋友，常常感到胸闷、腹胀。中医认为，这种情况可以通过“表里分消”的方法来调理，比如使用“实按灸”来疏通经络，缓解症状。此外，夏季容易出现的“暑内蕴证”也需要特别注意，可以通过饮食调理和适当的运动来缓解。对于孕妇来说，“妊娠脉”的调理尤为重要，中医认为“肾开窍于耳”，所以孕期多听一些舒缓的音乐也有助于胎儿的健康。如果出现“内生五邪”的情况，建议及时就医，采用“报刺”等针灸疗法来平衡体内的阴阳。希望大家都能在中医的智慧中找到适合自己的养生之道。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many friends have been feeling unwell, especially those with "Qi stagnation and water retention syndrome," who often experience chest tightness and abdominal distension. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that this condition can be regulated through the method of "resolving both the exterior and interior," such as using "pressing moxibustion" to unblock meridians and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, special attention should be paid to the "summer internal dampness syndrome" that is prone to occur in summer, which can be relieved through dietary adjustments and appropriate exercise. For pregnant women, the regulation of "pregnancy pulse" is particularly important. TCM believes that "the kidneys open into the ears," so listening to soothing music during pregnancy can also contribute to the health of the fetus. If there is a situation of "internal generation of five pathogens," it is recommended to seek medical attention promptly and use acupuncture therapies such as "reporting needling" to balance the body's yin and yang. It is hoped that everyone can find their own way of health preservation through the wisdom of TCM.

最近有朋友问我，为什么总是感觉身体沉重，容易疲劳，还伴有轻微的水肿类病症状。其实，这可能是“思伤脾”导致的。中医认为，脾为“将军之官”，主运化水湿，思虑过度会损伤脾的功能，导致水湿停滞，进而引发水肿。要改善这种情况，可以通过“补益中气”来增强脾的功能，同时结合“滋阴益气”的方法，调理身体的阴阳平衡。如果症状较重，还可以尝试“间隔灸”或“隔物灸”来温通经络，促进气血运行。总之，辨证施治是关键，避免“阳损及阴”的情况发生，才能从根本上解决问题。||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel physically heavy, easily fatigued, and accompanied by mild symptoms of edema-like illnesses. In fact, this might be caused by "overthinking harming the spleen." Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that the spleen is the "official of the general," responsible for transforming and transporting water and dampness. Excessive contemplation can impair the spleen's function, leading to stagnation of water and dampness, which in turn causes edema. To improve this condition, one can enhance the spleen's function by "tonifying the middle qi," while also combining methods of "nourishing yin and benefiting qi" to regulate the body's yin-yang balance. If the symptoms are severe, one might also try "interval moxibustion" or "indirect moxibustion" to warm and unblock the meridians, promoting the circulation of qi and blood. In summary, the key is to treat based on syndrome differentiation, avoiding the situation where "yang damage affects yin," in order to fundamentally solve the problem.

At this time, you might want to try "scraping therapy," which can help unblock meridians and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, summer is also the season when "yang water" overflows, easily leading to "stone" problems. It is recommended to drink more water to maintain the body's fluid balance. Moreover, emotional management is crucial to avoid "anger syndrome" harming the body. If skin issues such as "armpit abscess" or "ball wind" occur, remember to seek medical attention promptly. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "seeking yin within yang." In the hot summer, appropriately supplementing with some yin-nourishing foods, such as mung bean soup and lily, can help balance the body's yin and yang and maintain health.

If you notice rashes or pimples on your skin, it might be a sign of fetal toxin accumulation in your body. At this time, warming and activating the spleen yang is particularly important, and it can be regulated through moxibustion or dietary therapy. Additionally, those with large intestine heat syndrome should pay attention to their diet, keeping it light and avoiding spicy and stimulating foods.

在中医理论中，燥🗎和营与寒🗎蕴脾证是两种常见的病理状态，前者多因外感燥邪或内伤津液所致，后者则常因寒邪侵袭脾胃引起。五味调和是中医治疗中的重要原则，通过调节食物的五味属性，可以达到平衡阴阳的目的。暑热内郁证多发生在夏季，表现为高热、口渴等症状，需通过清热解暑的方法进行治疗。偏头痛在中医中常与风毒证相关，风邪侵袭头部经络，导致气血运行不畅。诊断时，中医师常采用三部九候遍诊法，通过全面检查患者的脉象、舌象等，以确定病因和病位。单重治疗法则强调针对单一病因进行治疗，以达到最佳疗效。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, dryness and nutrient deficiency syndrome and cold-dampness spleen syndrome are two common pathological states. The former is often caused by external dryness pathogens or internal injury to body fluids, while the latter is usually caused by cold pathogens invading the spleen and stomach. The harmony of the five flavors is an important principle in TCM treatment, and by adjusting the five-flavor properties of food, the goal of balancing yin and yang can be achieved. Summer heat internal stagnation syndrome mostly occurs in summer, manifesting as high fever, thirst, and other symptoms, and requires treatment through methods of clearing heat and relieving summer heat. Migraine in TCM is often related to wind toxin syndrome, where wind pathogens invade the meridians of the head, leading to poor circulation of qi and blood. During diagnosis, TCM practitioners often use the three-region and nine-position comprehensive examination method, thoroughly checking the patient's pulse and tongue conditions to determine the cause and location of the disease. The single-cause treatment principle emphasizes treating a single cause to achieve the best therapeutic effect.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友出现了“血寒证”的症状，手脚冰凉、面色苍白，这时候就需要一些“温里药”来调理了。中医讲究“内所因”，认为这些症状往往与体内的寒邪有关。特别是“中焦如沤”，脾胃功能不佳，更容易导致寒邪入侵。有些人还会出现“捻衣摸床”的现象，晚上睡觉时总是觉得冷，甚至不自觉地去摸被子。如果你发现自己有“少阴热化证”的表现，比如心烦、口干，那可能是寒邪化热了。此外，“皮水”问题也不容忽视，皮肤干燥、瘙痒，可能与体内的寒湿有关。对于“肝痨”患者来说，更要注意保暖，避免寒邪进一步损伤肝脏。总之，秋冬季节，调理好体内的寒湿，才能健康过冬。||Recently, the weather has turned cooler, and many friends have experienced symptoms of "blood cold syndrome," such as cold hands and feet, and a pale complexion. At this time, some "warming medicines" are needed for regulation. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "internal causes," believing that these symptoms are often related to cold pathogens within the body. Especially with "the middle burner being like a fermenting vat," poor spleen and stomach function can more easily lead to the invasion of cold pathogens. Some people may also experience the phenomenon of "twisting clothes and feeling the bed," always feeling cold when sleeping at night, and even unconsciously reaching for the blanket. If you find yourself showing signs of "Shaoyin heat transformation syndrome," such as irritability and dry mouth, it might be a case of cold pathogens transforming into heat. Additionally, the issue of "skin water" should not be overlooked; dry and itchy skin may be related to cold dampness within the body. For patients with "liver consumption," it is even more important to keep warm to avoid further damage to the liver from cold pathogens. In summary, during the autumn and winter seasons, regulating the cold and dampness within the body is essential for a healthy winter.

Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "nourishing the mother when there is deficiency," so when the spleen is weak, one can enhance physical constitution by regulating the spleen and stomach. Additionally, boils are a common issue during this season, especially for those with a damp-heat constitution. Female friends should also pay attention to abnormal vaginal discharge, which often indicates excessive dampness in the body. For those with eye conditions, frequent massage of acupoints such as Hegu (LI4) can help alleviate eye fatigue. If a choppy pulse is detected during pulse diagnosis, it indicates poor circulation of qi and blood in the body, necessitating timely regulation. Finally, observing facial complexion is an important diagnostic method in traditional Chinese medicine; a healthy complexion should be rosy and radiant, and if the face appears yellow or pale, one should be alert to potential health issues.

For example, the concept of "the heart dislikes heat" is something we can often feel in daily life—when we are irritable, our bodies tend to feel hot and uncomfortable. Additionally, "heart and gallbladder qi deficiency syndrome" is a common constitutional issue, manifesting as being easily startled and having restless sleep. For such problems, traditional Chinese medicine often uses the method of "increasing fluids and promoting bowel movements" to regulate the body and help restore balance. There is also "warm toxin eruption," which is particularly common during seasonal changes, presenting as red spots and itching on the skin. Finally, mentioning "metal-type individuals," people with this constitution usually have fair skin, tend to sweat easily, and have a cold constitution.

在中医理论中，五行学说贯穿于疾病的诊断与治疗之中，如寒厥与积聚的形成，往往与五行失衡密切相关。寒厥多因阳气不足，寒气内侵所致，而积聚则是气血瘀滞，痰湿凝结的结果。在治疗上，中医强调舍脉从症，即根据具体症状而非单纯依赖脉象进行辨证施治。例如，对于痧病，常采用清利头目的方法，以疏散风热，缓解症状。此外，蛇丹作为一种外治法，通过局部刺激达到疏通经络、调和气血的目的。主运理论则指导我们根据季节变化调整治疗方案，以适应自然界的变化规律。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, the Five Elements doctrine is integral to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, such as the formation of cold syncope and accumulation, which are often closely related to the imbalance of the Five Elements. Cold syncope is mostly caused by insufficient yang energy and internal invasion of cold, while accumulation results from stagnation of qi and blood, and coagulation of phlegm and dampness. In treatment, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes focusing on symptoms rather than solely relying on pulse diagnosis for syndrome differentiation and treatment. For example, for the treatment of sha disease, methods to clear and benefit the head and eyes are often used to disperse wind-heat and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, snake cinnabar, as an external treatment method, achieves the purpose of dredging meridians and harmonizing qi and blood through local stimulation. The theory of main movement guides us to adjust treatment plans according to seasonal changes to adapt to the natural laws of variation.

'Pancreatic disease' as a condition related to the pancreas, often manifests as signs such as 'clubbing of fingers', and requires treatment through methods like 'clearing heat and purging the lungs'. During the diagnostic process, 'palpation' as a tactile technique helps doctors accurately assess the condition. Additionally, 'spontaneous sweating' as one of the common symptoms is often related to the dysfunction of the 'conduction official', and treatment can involve 'moxibustion' to warm the meridians, dispel cold, and harmonize qi and blood. By comprehensively applying these TCM terms and methods, a more thorough understanding and treatment of related diseases can be achieved.

最近有朋友问我，总是感觉胸口闷闷的，时不时会“太息”，也就是长叹一口气，这其实是肝气郁结的表现。中医讲究“调和肝脾剂”，通过调理肝脾，可以缓解这种不适。另外，有些人可能会出现“虚痉”的情况，这往往与“肾藏志”功能失调有关。肾主藏精，精不足则志不坚，容易引发身体的各种不适。还有，如果感觉口干舌燥，可能是“气不化津”，这时候可以适当用一些“补阳药”来调理。最后，提醒大家，如果脸上长了“恋眉疮”，别急着挤，这可能是“经络之气”不畅的表现，调理好内在，皮肤问题自然也会改善。||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel a tightness in their chest and occasionally sigh deeply, which is actually a manifestation of liver qi stagnation. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "harmonizing the liver and spleen," and by regulating these organs, such discomfort can be alleviated. Additionally, some people might experience "deficiency spasms," often related to the dysfunction of the "kidney storing will." The kidneys are responsible for storing essence; insufficient essence leads to weak will, easily causing various physical discomforts. Moreover, if you feel dry mouth and throat, it might be due to "qi failing to transform into fluid," and it's appropriate to use some "yang-tonifying herbs" for regulation. Lastly, a reminder: if you develop "lian mei sores" on your face, don't rush to squeeze them, as this could be a sign of "blocked meridian qi." By improving internal health, skin issues will naturally improve as well.

在中医理论中，魄门作为人体重要的排泄器官，其功能状态直接反映了体内气血的盛衰。热盛动血证常表现为红舌，这是由于体内热邪炽盛，迫血妄行所致。窦道的形成往往与体内湿热积聚有关，治疗时需随证取穴，以调和气血。妊娠偏头痛多因肝阳上亢或气血不足引起，治疗时应注重开合虚实的原则，以平衡阴阳。脾气虚证则表现为食欲不振、乏力等症状，治疗时需补脾益气，以恢复脾胃的正常功能。通过综合运用这些中医术语，可以更全面地理解和治疗相关疾病。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, the anus, as an important excretory organ of the human body, directly reflects the abundance or deficiency of qi and blood within the body. The syndrome of excessive heat stirring blood often manifests as a red tongue, which is caused by the intense heat evil within the body forcing the blood to move recklessly. The formation of sinus tracts is often related to the accumulation of damp-heat within the body, and treatment requires selecting acupoints according to the syndrome to harmonize qi and blood. Migraine during pregnancy is mostly caused by hyperactivity of liver yang or deficiency of qi and blood, and treatment should focus on the principle of opening and closing, deficiency and excess, to balance yin and yang.

最近有朋友问我，为什么有时候舌头上会有染苔的现象，这其实是体内湿气过重的表现。说到湿气，不得不提慢脾风，这种病症常常让人感到疲倦无力。如果你经常感到瘙痒，尤其是夜间更甚，那可能是厥阴病证的表现。中医认为，肾在志为恐，情绪波动大的人往往肾气不足。把脉时如果发现浮脉，可能是外感风寒。对于孕妇来说，妊娠小便不通是个常见问题，需要及时调理。还有肛漏，虽然尴尬，但也是身体发出的信号，提醒我们要注意饮食和生活习惯。希望大家都能通过这些小知识，更好地了解自己的身体。||Recently, a friend asked me why there is sometimes a phenomenon of tongue coating, which is actually a manifestation of excessive dampness in the body. Speaking of dampness, one cannot help but mention slow spleen wind, a condition that often makes people feel tired and weak. If you frequently feel itchy, especially more so at night, it might be a manifestation of Jueyin disease syndrome. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the kidney is associated with fear in emotions, and people with large emotional fluctuations often have insufficient kidney qi. If a floating pulse is detected during pulse diagnosis, it may be due to external wind-cold. For pregnant women, difficulty in urination during pregnancy is a common issue that requires timely regulation. Also, anal leakage, though embarrassing, is a signal from the body reminding us to pay attention to diet and lifestyle habits. I hope everyone can better understand their own body through these small pieces of knowledge.

Spleen and stomach yang deficiency syndrome is a common spleen system disease, characterized by symptoms such as poor appetite and cold limbs. For such conditions, traditional Chinese medicine often employs methods to warm yang and strengthen the spleen. Additionally, bee sting therapy, as a unique treatment method, can effectively alleviate pain symptoms such as bi syndrome by stimulating specific acupoints. Infantile sudden cough is mostly caused by external wind-cold or internal dietary injury, and treatment needs to consider both the lungs and spleen.

I remember once encountering a patient whose pulse showed a "leather pulse," which made me realize there might be some issues with his qi and blood circulation. Using the "extending fingers and sitting wrist" technique, I helped him adjust the flow of his meridians. Additionally, I learned about the concept of "guiding the meridian to report to the envoy," which emphasizes how drugs achieve therapeutic effects through specific meridians, greatly aiding in understanding the mechanism of action of Chinese medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "same year meeting" refers to the coordination of the human body with the periodic changes of nature, while "yang killing yin hiding" describes the dynamic balance between yin and yang.

After a detailed consultation and pulse diagnosis, I found that the patient also exhibited symptoms of "floating yang deficiency," including dizziness, facial flushing, and irritability. Based on his tongue and pulse signs, I concluded that he also suffered from a deficiency of "liver blood." Therefore, I adopted the "blood-regulating method" for treatment, supplemented with "massage auxiliary tools." After a period of treatment, the patient's symptoms significantly improved; not only did the "pica" disappear, but the "yellow swelling disease" also alleviated.

最近有朋友问我，为什么总是感觉胸口闷闷的，像是有什么东西堵着，尤其是饭后更明显。这让我想到了中医里的“饮停胸胁证”，其实就是体内湿气太重，水饮停滞在胸胁部位。要解决这个问题，可以从“清热排脓”入手，帮助身体排出多余的湿气和毒素。同时，配合“活血消积”的方法，促进血液循环，消除积滞。中医认为“阴脉之海”是调节全身气血的关键，尤其是女性朋友，更要注意调理。如果平时还伴有小便浑浊、腰膝酸软的情况，可能是“膏淋”的表现，这时候“补脾益肾”就显得尤为重要了。另外，中医常说“血能载气”，气血充足才能让身体更健康。至于“漏疳”，虽然听起来陌生，但它其实和脾胃虚弱有关，调理好了脾胃，这些问题自然迎刃而解。||Recently, a friend asked me why they always feel a tightness in their chest, as if something is blocking it, especially after meals. This reminded me of the "fluid retention in the chest and hypochondrium syndrome" in traditional Chinese medicine, which is essentially caused by excessive dampness in the body, where fluids stagnate in the chest and hypochondrium area. To address this issue, one can start with "clearing heat and expelling pus" to help the body eliminate excess dampness and toxins. At the same time, combining methods to "activate blood circulation and resolve stagnation" can promote blood flow and eliminate blockages. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the "sea of yin meridians" is key to regulating the body's qi and blood, especially for women, who should pay more attention to regulating this. If there are also symptoms like cloudy urine and soreness in the lower back and knees, it might be a sign of "turbid strangury," where "tonifying the spleen and kidneys" becomes particularly important. Additionally, traditional Chinese medicine often says that "blood can carry qi," meaning that sufficient qi and blood are essential for a healthier body. As for "leaking gan," although it sounds unfamiliar, it is actually related to spleen and stomach weakness. By properly regulating the spleen and stomach, these issues can naturally be resolved.

Warm epidemic, as a type of externally contracted disease, is often accompanied by fever symptoms and requires treatment through methods that expel pathogens and release the exterior. The front and back point combination method is an important strategy in acupuncture treatment, which regulates the body's qi and blood and alleviates symptoms such as external hemorrhoids and nosebleeds by combining specific acupoints. These treatment methods not only reflect the holistic concept of traditional Chinese medicine but also demonstrate its unique advantages in dealing with complex diseases.

最近在门诊遇到不少朋友提到晚上“梦交”频繁，白天精神不振，这其实与“心包”功能失调有关。中医认为，心包主神明，若心包受扰，易导致睡眠质量下降，甚至出现梦交。此外，长期久坐或运动不当，容易引发“膝痹”，尤其是“瘀血阻络证”的朋友，膝盖疼痛常伴随“喘证”，这是因为气血运行不畅，经络受阻。建议大家平时多练习一些舒缓的“拳势”，既能“除🗎通络”，又能调理“脾系证类”，帮助身体恢复平衡。养生从细节做起，健康从经络开始！||Recently, many friends have mentioned frequent "dream intercourse" at night and feeling lethargic during the day during outpatient visits. This is actually related to the dysfunction of the "pericardium." Traditional Chinese medicine believes that the pericardium governs the mind, and if the pericardium is disturbed, it can easily lead to a decline in sleep quality, even resulting in dream intercourse. Additionally, prolonged sitting or improper exercise can easily trigger "knee paralysis," especially for those with "blood stasis obstructing the collaterals syndrome," where knee pain is often accompanied by "wheezing syndrome." This is because the flow of qi and blood is not smooth, and the meridians are blocked. It is recommended that everyone practice some gentle "boxing postures" regularly, which can both "remove obstructions and unblock the collaterals" and regulate "spleen-related syndromes," helping the body restore balance. Health preservation starts with the details, and health begins with the meridians!

Actually, it's a common minor issue during pregnancy. Speaking of this, we have to mention the theory of acupoints in traditional Chinese medicine; finding the right acupoints for regulation can be particularly effective. However, one must be cautious with medication, as drugs that are too strong can be harmful to the fetus. The weather has been changing a lot recently, and during the Taiyi Tianfu season, it's easy to suffer from sand distension, so everyone should pay attention to keeping warm. Speaking of health preservation, our "house of intelligence"—the brain—also needs good care. Some female friends have also encountered the problem of vaginal atrophy, and actually, needle retention therapy works quite well.

最近有不少朋友问我关于“阳黄病”的问题，其实这种病症多与“胃热证”有关，尤其是“木形人”更容易出现这类问题。中医讲究“补气固摄”，可以通过一些“缓方”来调理，比如用“微火”煎煮药材，慢慢调理身体。在诊脉时，医生会“布指”仔细感受脉象的变化，判断病情。如果是“癫病”患者，更需要耐心调理，避免急躁。总之，中医讲究整体调理，大家平时要注意饮食和作息，才能更好地预防和治疗这些病症。||Recently, many friends have asked me about "Yang Huang disease." In fact, this condition is often related to "stomach heat syndrome," especially for those with a "wood constitution," who are more prone to such issues. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "tonifying qi and consolidating the body," and it can be regulated through some "gentle prescriptions," such as simmering herbs over a "low flame" to gradually adjust the body. When taking the pulse, the doctor will carefully feel the changes in the pulse by "placing the fingers" to assess the condition. For patients with "mania," more patience is required in treatment to avoid impatience. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine focuses on holistic regulation. Everyone should pay attention to diet and daily routines to better prevent and treat these conditions.

Additionally, medicinal pastes are also a good choice, especially those with the effects of tonifying the kidneys and consolidating astringency. These pastes not only help to resolve phlegm and open the orifices but also regulate the body and improve issues related to downward tendencies. In summary, the key to health maintenance during the autumn and winter seasons lies in regulating the internal environment and maintaining the body's balance and health.

在中医临床实践中，提法是一种重要的诊断手段，通过观察舌象可以辨识多种病症。例如，枯舌与莲花舌的形态差异常提示不同的病理状态，枯舌多见于阴虚内热，而莲花舌则可能与下焦热证相关。此外，吞酸症状常与胃气上逆有关，需结合表实证的辨证施治。对于白疕等皮肤病症，软坚消癥的治疗原则常被采用，以调和气血、疏通经络。这些术语的综合运用，有助于更精准地把握病情，制定个性化的治疗方案。||In the clinical practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine, tongue diagnosis is an important diagnostic method, and various diseases can be identified by observing the tongue's appearance. For example, the morphological differences between a withered tongue and a lotus tongue often indicate different pathological states; a withered tongue is commonly seen in yin deficiency with internal heat, while a lotus tongue may be related to heat syndrome in the lower jiao. Additionally, symptoms such as acid regurgitation are often associated with the upward reversal of stomach qi, requiring treatment based on the differentiation of external excess patterns. For skin conditions like psoriasis, the treatment principle of softening hardness and resolving masses is often employed to harmonize qi and blood and unblock meridians. The comprehensive application of these terms helps to more accurately grasp the condition and formulate personalized treatment plans.

最近天气变化无常，很多朋友都出现了“但寒不热”的症状，尤其是那些肺肾气虚证的朋友，更容易感到身体不适。中医认为，这种情况多与体内气血运行不畅有关，建议通过“活血行滞”的方法来调理。比如，可以适当饮用一些温热的茶水，缓解“口渴欲饮”的感觉。此外，像“葡萄疫”和“风痧”这类外感病邪也容易趁虚而入，大家要注意保暖。如果症状较重，不妨试试“巨刺”疗法，通过刺激特定穴位来疏通经络。最后提醒大家，秋冬季节“火易生风”，饮食上要避免过于辛辣，以免加重体内燥热。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many friends have experienced symptoms of "feeling cold but not hot," especially those with lung and kidney qi deficiency, who are more prone to feeling unwell. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that this condition is often related to poor circulation of qi and blood in the body, and it is recommended to regulate it through methods that "activate blood and remove stagnation." For example, drinking some warm tea can help alleviate the feeling of "thirst and desire to drink." Additionally, external pathogenic factors like "grape epidemic" and "wind rash" can easily take advantage of a weakened state, so it is important to stay warm. If symptoms are severe, trying "great puncture" therapy, which stimulates specific acupuncture points to unblock meridians, may be beneficial. Finally, it is important to remind everyone that during the autumn and winter seasons, "fire easily generates wind," so it is advisable to avoid overly spicy foods in the diet to prevent exacerbating internal dryness and heat.

在中医临床实践中，真实假虚的病机分析至关重要，尤其在治疗头风病和口僻等复杂病症时，需结合囟解和气关的病理变化进行辨证施治。泻下药作为引经药的重要组成部分，常用于疏导药毒，促进邪气外排。然而，药毒积聚若未及时清除，可能导致病情迁延不愈。因此，合理运用泻下药并结合引经药的导向作用，是治疗真实假虚证候的关键策略。通过调和气关、疏通囟解，可有效缓解头风病的症状，同时改善口僻患者的局部气血运行，达到标本兼治的效果。||In clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine, the analysis of the pathogenesis of true excess and false deficiency is crucial, especially when treating complex diseases such as headache and facial paralysis. It is necessary to combine the pathological changes of the fontanelle and the qi gate for syndrome differentiation and treatment. Purgative drugs, as an important part of channel-guiding drugs, are often used to guide out toxic substances and promote the expulsion of pathogenic factors. However, if the accumulation of toxic substances is not cleared in time, it may lead to prolonged illness. Therefore, the rational use of purgative drugs combined with the guiding effect of channel-guiding drugs is a key strategy in treating true excess and false deficiency syndromes. By harmonizing the qi gate and dredging the fontanelle, the symptoms of headache can be effectively alleviated, while improving the local qi and blood circulation in patients with facial paralysis, achieving both symptomatic and root treatment effects.

In treating yin abscess, TCM often employs methods to awaken the spleen, regulating spleen and stomach functions to promote the circulation of qi and blood, thereby alleviating symptoms. Additionally, qi syndrome is an important factor to consider in the treatment of yin abscess, and acupuncture can effectively unblock meridians and improve qi stagnation and blood stasis. During acupuncture, the technique of "hanging the head" is commonly used to precisely stimulate acupoints and enhance therapeutic effects. For patients with constipation, medications that moisten the intestines and clear heat can help eliminate internal heat toxins and promote recovery. In summer, the invasion of summer filth can easily aggravate yin abscess, making heatstroke prevention and cooling important measures for both prevention and treatment.

在中医理论中，"百晬内嗽"是指婴儿出生后百日内出现的咳嗽症状，常与"寒邪束表证"或"风寒束表证"相关，表现为外感风寒导致的表证。治疗此类症状，中医常采用"和解法"，通过调和表里、平衡阴阳来缓解症状。对于成人，若出现"口麻"现象，可能与气血不畅有关，此时可考虑使用"化瘀宽心"的方法，通过活血化瘀来改善局部血液循环。此外，"吐法"作为一种传统的中医治法，适用于某些实证，通过催吐来排除体内病邪。在治疗"乳疽"等乳腺疾病时，中医可能会推荐使用"栓剂"，这种药物形式便于局部应用，有助于直接作用于病灶，促进病情恢复。这些方法体现了中医治疗疾病的多样性和针对性。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "bai zui nei sou" refers to coughing symptoms that appear within the first hundred days after a baby's birth, often associated with "cold evil binding the exterior syndrome" or "wind-cold binding the exterior syndrome," manifesting as exterior syndrome caused by external wind-cold. To treat such symptoms, traditional Chinese medicine often employs the "harmonizing and resolving method," which alleviates symptoms by harmonizing the exterior and interior and balancing yin and yang. For adults, if "numbness of the mouth" occurs, it may be related to poor circulation of qi and blood, in which case the method of "removing stasis and soothing the heart" can be considered, improving local blood circulation by promoting blood flow and removing stasis. Additionally, "emetic therapy" as a traditional Chinese medical treatment is suitable for certain excess syndromes, expelling pathogenic factors from the body through induced vomiting. In treating breast diseases such as "breast abscess," traditional Chinese medicine might recommend the use of "suppositories," a form of medication that facilitates local application, helping to directly act on the lesion and promote recovery. These methods reflect the diversity and specificity of traditional Chinese medicine in treating diseases.

Shaoyin disease syndrome, as one of the six meridian disease syndromes, often manifests as symptoms of deficiency and cold, whereas dryness and stomach-regulating agents are used to harmonize stomach dryness and promote digestion. The official of dredging in traditional Chinese medicine refers to the bladder, and its dysfunction may lead to heat accumulation skin syndrome, characterized by symptoms such as skin heat and itching. Additionally, white collapse, as a gynecological disease, is often related to yin deficiency blood dryness syndrome, and treatment requires attention to both nourishing yin and stopping bleeding. Other syndromes such as heat accumulation skin syndrome require clearing heat and cooling blood to restore the normal function of the skin.

痿证类病是中医临床常见的一类疾病，其病因多与肝胃气滞证、气滞血瘀证密切相关。肝胃气滞证患者常表现为脘腹胀满、嗳气频繁，而气滞血瘀证则多见疼痛固定、舌质紫暗等症状。在治疗上，中医强调调和气血，疏通经络，以达到大周天的循环畅通。此外，心肾不交证也是痿证类病的重要病因之一，患者常伴有失眠多梦、腰膝酸软等表现。对于月经先期的女性患者，中医认为多与肝郁气滞、血热妄行有关，治疗上需疏肝解郁、清热凉血。暑证则多见于夏季，患者常表现为发热、口渴、汗多等症状，治疗上以清热解暑为主。语言謇涩多见于中风后遗症，中医认为与痰瘀阻络有关，治疗上需化痰通络、活血化瘀。||Atrophy syndrome is a common category of diseases in clinical traditional Chinese medicine, often closely related to liver-stomach qi stagnation syndrome and qi stagnation with blood stasis syndrome. Patients with liver-stomach qi stagnation syndrome often exhibit symptoms such as abdominal distension and frequent belching, while those with qi stagnation with blood stasis syndrome commonly experience fixed pain and a purplish-dark tongue. In treatment, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes harmonizing qi and blood, and dredging meridians to achieve smooth circulation throughout the body. Additionally, disharmony between the heart and kidney is also a significant cause of atrophy syndrome, often accompanied by symptoms such as insomnia, excessive dreaming, and soreness and weakness in the lower back and knees. For female patients with early menstruation, traditional Chinese medicine often attributes this to liver depression and qi stagnation, as well as reckless movement of blood due to heat, and treatment focuses on soothing the liver to relieve depression, clearing heat, and cooling the blood. Summerheat syndrome is more common in summer, with patients often presenting symptoms such as fever, thirst, and excessive sweating, and treatment primarily involves clearing heat and relieving summerheat. Slurred speech is often seen in sequelae of stroke, and traditional Chinese medicine associates it with phlegm and blood stasis obstructing the collaterals, with treatment focusing on resolving phlegm, dredging collaterals, and promoting blood circulation to remove stasis.

Additionally, friends with wind-heat invading the lung syndrome should be aware that the appearance of geographic tongue might indicate the presence of heat toxins in the body, making timely regulation important. Traditional Chinese medicine often says, "Excessive fire consumes qi," meaning that excessive internal heat can deplete vital energy, so it's important to maintain a light diet and avoid spicy and stimulating foods. Finally, I hope everyone can find their own coolness and health in the scorching summer, just like "a dying lamp reigniting."

Gestational diabetes is often caused by a deficiency of yin blood, leading to lung yin deficiency, and requires nourishing lung yin to harmonize qi and blood. Warm toxin-induced rashes are typically caused by external warm toxins and internal damp-heat, leading to skin rashes, and require treatment to clear heat and detoxify. Additionally, the association between cold stagnation in the liver meridian and scrotal wind is noteworthy, as cold stagnation in the liver meridian can lead to scrotal wind, manifesting as scrotal itching and discomfort. The clinical manifestations of phlegm clouding the heart orifice and injury-induced convulsions are similar, both presenting with mental confusion and limb convulsions, and require treatment to resolve phlegm, open the orifices, and relax the tendons. In summary, gestational diabetes, warm toxin-induced rashes, cold stagnation in the liver meridian, scrotal wind, phlegm clouding the heart orifice, and injury-induced convulsions each have distinct characteristics in terms of etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment, necessitating syndrome differentiation and tailored treatment to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.

When the Lung Meridian is imbalanced, symptoms such as dry cough without phlegm, dry mouth, and dry tongue may occur, indicating a syndrome of lung dryness and fluid deficiency. Additionally, the weakness of heart yang can lead to a decline in bodily functions, especially in pediatric pica, where insufficient heart yang often manifests as abnormal appetite and digestive disorders. To address these symptoms, traditional Chinese medicine often employs methods to warm and tonify stomach yang, enhancing physical constitution by regulating the spleen and stomach. Meanwhile, the technique of extending fingers and sitting on the wrist is a common Chinese massage method used to relieve upper limb fatigue and promote blood circulation. In treating chronic conditions such as hidden beam qi and bone steaming, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes comprehensive regulation, combining medication and manual techniques to achieve the goal of balancing yin and yang and harmonizing qi and blood.

产后身痛是许多新妈妈常见的症状，通常与气血不足、寒湿侵袭有关。中医认为，产后身痛多因气血运行不畅，导致寒热往来，表现为身体各部位的疼痛。此外，蛀节疔和肉刺也是常见的皮肤问题，多因湿热内蕴或燥邪侵袭所致。热困脾证则表现为脾胃功能失调，常伴有食欲不振、腹胀等症状。外障类病如鼻渊，多因风寒湿邪侵袭鼻窍，导致鼻塞、流涕等症状。中医治疗这些病症时，常采用调理气血、祛风散寒、清热利湿等方法，以恢复身体的平衡状态。||Postpartum body pain is a common symptom among many new mothers, often related to insufficient qi and blood, and invasion of cold and dampness. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that postpartum body pain is mostly due to poor circulation of qi and blood, leading to alternating cold and heat, manifested as pain in various parts of the body. In addition, boils and corns are common skin problems, mostly caused by internal damp-heat or invasion of dryness. Heat stagnation in the spleen syndrome manifests as dysfunction of the spleen and stomach, often accompanied by symptoms such as poor appetite and abdominal distension. External obstruction diseases such as sinusitis are mostly caused by the invasion of wind, cold, and dampness into the nasal cavity, leading to symptoms such as nasal congestion and runny nose. In treating these conditions, Traditional Chinese Medicine often employs methods such as regulating qi and blood, dispelling wind and cold, clearing heat and dampness, to restore the body's balance.

Medicinal cuisine, as an auxiliary treatment method, helps improve the symptoms of spleen-related diseases by regulating the functions of the spleen and stomach. The traction method, a traditional Chinese medical technique, effectively alleviates muscle tension and pain through stretching and pulling, showing unique efficacy especially in treating muscle atrophy diseases such as flaccidity. Additionally, the interstice between the skin and muscles, known as "couli," directly affects the body's defensive functions through its opening and closing states. Stimulating specific acupoints can regulate the couli and enhance the body's resistance. In gynecological diseases, postpartum blood stasis impacting the heart is a serious complication, which traditional Chinese medicine treats by promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis to prevent the condition from progressing to the pericardium, thereby affecting heart function. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine effectively treats and prevents various diseases by comprehensively utilizing methods such as medicinal cuisine, traction techniques, couli regulation, and acupoint stimulation.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了太阳中风证的症状，如头痛、发热等。中医认为，这与肝系失调有关，尤其是阴阳两虚的人群更容易受到影响。腹诊是中医诊断的重要手段，通过触摸腹部可以了解体内气血的运行情况。对于肺胃风热证的患者，建议多喝温水，避免辛辣食物。孕妇在妊娠期间容易出现妊娠眩晕，这可能是邪害空窍所致，需及时调理。此外，火扰心神证也会导致失眠、烦躁等症状，建议通过中药调理来平衡体内阴阳。||Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, and many people have shown symptoms of sunstroke, such as headaches and fever. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that this is related to liver system disorders, especially in people with dual deficiency of yin and yang, who are more susceptible to being affected. Abdominal diagnosis is an important method in TCM, where the condition of qi and blood circulation in the body can be understood by touching the abdomen. For patients with lung and stomach wind-heat syndrome, it is recommended to drink more warm water and avoid spicy foods. Pregnant women are prone to gestational dizziness during pregnancy, which may be caused by evil harming the empty orifices and requires timely regulation. In addition, fire disturbing the heart-mind syndrome can also lead to symptoms such as insomnia and irritability, and it is recommended to balance the body's yin and yang through TCM regulation.

最近天气转凉，很多朋友都感觉手脚冰凉，这其实是“寒易伤阳”的表现。中医讲究“真阴”与阳气的平衡，寒邪容易损伤阳气，导致身体不适。这时候，可以试试一些温补的“膏方”，比如用“饮片”熬制的滋补汤药，既能温阳又能养阴。此外，中医的“腧穴定位法”也能帮助我们找到身体的穴位，通过按摩来缓解“气滞阻证”。平时饮食上也要注意“配伍”，比如寒性食物不宜过多，以免加重寒气。地支中的“子午流注”理论也提醒我们，顺应自然规律，调整作息，才能更好地养护身体。||Recently, the weather has turned cooler, and many friends have been feeling cold hands and feet, which is actually a manifestation of "cold easily damaging yang." Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emphasizes the balance between "true yin" and yang energy, as cold pathogens can easily harm yang energy, leading to physical discomfort. At this time, you can try some warming and nourishing "paste formulas," such as nourishing decoctions made from "herbal slices," which can both warm yang and nourish yin. Additionally, TCM's "acupoint localization method" can help us find the body's acupoints, and through massage, we can alleviate "qi stagnation syndrome." In daily diet, it's also important to pay attention to "compatibility," such as avoiding excessive consumption of cold-natured foods to prevent aggravating the cold. The theory of "Zi Wu Liu Zhu" (midnight-noon and ebb-flow) in the earthly branches also reminds us to follow natural rhythms and adjust our routines to better care for our bodies.

If you feel dizzy or unwell, you might want to try traditional Chinese medicine "lozenges," which are convenient to carry and suitable for daily health maintenance. Additionally, pay attention to your diet to avoid exacerbating "gan re bing" (liver heat disease). It's advisable to consume more foods that clear heat and moisten dryness, helping to "dispel heat and preserve fluids." Recently, there's been talk of a condition called "cai wu zi bing," which, although rare, should be taken seriously. In summary, maintaining a state of "dryness and harmony" is essential to better cope with the health challenges brought by seasonal changes.

在中医理论中，"表邪内陷"是指外邪由表入里的病理过程，常导致病情加重。针对此类病症，中医常采用"特定穴"进行针灸治疗，如温和灸法，通过温和的热力刺激穴位，调和气血，缓解症状。此外，"肾主水液"的理论指出，肾脏在调节体内水液平衡中起关键作用，因此，使用"利水渗剂"可以帮助排除体内多余水分，减轻水肿等症状。在治疗过程中，还需注意"筋惕肉瞤"的现象，即肌肉不自主的跳动，这可能是体内气血失调的表现。对于"丹痧"这类皮肤病，中医认为多由热毒引起，治疗时需清热解毒，同时调理脾胃，防止"肥气"积聚，即体内脂肪过多，影响气血运行。综上所述，中医治疗强调辨证施治，通过多种方法综合调理，达到治疗疾病的目的。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "external pathogens invading the interior" refers to the pathological process where external pathogens move from the surface to the inside of the body, often leading to the worsening of the condition. For such conditions, TCM often employs "specific acupoints" for acupuncture treatment, such as mild moxibustion, which uses gentle heat to stimulate acupoints, harmonize qi and blood, and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, the theory that "the kidneys govern water metabolism" indicates that the kidneys play a crucial role in regulating the body's water balance. Therefore, using "diuretic and dampness-removing agents" can help eliminate excess body fluids and reduce symptoms like edema. During treatment, attention should also be paid to the phenomenon of "muscle twitching and trembling," which may indicate an imbalance of qi and blood in the body. For skin diseases such as "scarlet fever," TCM believes they are often caused by heat toxins, and treatment requires clearing heat and detoxifying, while also regulating the spleen and stomach to prevent the accumulation of "fat qi," or excessive body fat, which can affect the flow of qi and blood. In summary, TCM treatment emphasizes syndrome differentiation and comprehensive regulation through various methods to achieve the goal of treating diseases.

Postpartum blood dizziness is mostly caused by deficiency of both qi and blood, leading to floating of deficient yang, manifesting as dizziness and blurred vision, and in severe cases, even bulging eyes. Gallbladder heat with phlegm disturbance is characterized by distending pain in the chest and hypochondrium, accompanied by excessive phlegm and a bitter taste in the mouth. Treatment requires regulating qi and harmonizing the stomach to balance the qi of the liver and gallbladder. Additionally, evil invasion disease and fatigue goiter are also common conditions in clinical Chinese medicine. Evil invasion disease is often caused by external pathogenic factors leading to qi and blood imbalance, while fatigue goiter is related to long-term strain and emotional distress. In treating these conditions, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes syndrome differentiation and treatment, aiming to achieve therapeutic effects by regulating qi and blood, soothing the liver, and regulating qi.

Auricular eczema is typically caused by external wind-heat invasion, and the treatment should aim to release the exterior and promote eruption, as well as clear heat and detoxify. Additionally, the treatment of pediatric whooping cough, a common childhood illness, should emphasize methods to disperse lung qi and relieve cough. The treatment of chyluria should address both clearing heat and promoting diuresis, as well as tonifying the spleen and kidney, to achieve both symptomatic and root treatment. In summary, for different diseases, it is essential to flexibly apply traditional Chinese medicine theories and tailor individualized treatment plans based on specific conditions.

最近很多朋友问我，为什么总是感觉胃部不适，可能是胃疡在作怪。中医认为，胃疡多因阴阳偏衰，禀赋不足所致。平时可以多吃些升浮药，如生姜、陈皮等，帮助清心泻脾，调理脾胃。另外，齿为骨之余，牙齿问题也可能反映骨骼健康，尤其是🗎痹患者更要注意。膏肓部位的疼痛也不容忽视，及时调理才能避免小病拖成大病。||Recently, many friends have been asking me why they often feel discomfort in their stomach, which might be caused by stomach ulcers. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that stomach ulcers are often due to an imbalance of yin and yang and insufficient innate endowment. It is advisable to consume more uplifting herbs like ginger and dried tangerine peel to help clear the heart and purge the spleen, thereby regulating the spleen and stomach. Additionally, teeth are considered the surplus of bones, and dental issues may reflect bone health, especially for those suffering from arthritis, who should pay extra attention. Pain in the gaohuang area should not be overlooked either; timely regulation is necessary to prevent minor ailments from developing into major illnesses.

At this time, one can try traditional Chinese medicine that "clears heat with sweet and cold properties," such as pears and lily bulbs, which can both clear heat and nourish yin. If there is an accumulation of "yin evil" in the body, leading to the internal generation of phlegm-dampness, one can appropriately use the method of "inducing vomiting to expel phlegm" to help expel the phlegm-dampness from the body. For acute diseases such as "seasonal cholera," traditional Chinese medicine also has the traditional therapy of "garlic moxibustion," which combines moxibustion with garlic to expel evil and support the righteous qi. Additionally, if there is blood stasis or swelling in the body, one might try traditional Chinese medicine formulas that "remove stasis and reduce swelling" to help unblock the meridians and restore health.

最近很多朋友问我，为什么年纪轻轻就开始掉头发？其实这跟“肾其华在发”有很大关系。肾气不足，头发自然就失去了光泽和韧性。想要改善这种情况，除了“补气摄乳”外，还可以试试“泄热解毒”的方法，比如喝点菊花茶或者金银花茶，帮助身体排毒。另外，中医里有一种“涌吐药”，可以帮助身体排出多余的毒素，但使用时要谨慎。还有，平时可以多做些“插法”按摩，帮助气血流通，让身体“节节贯串”，气血顺畅了，头发自然也会好起来。记住，养生要“性趋下”，顺应自然规律，才能事半功倍哦！||Recently, many friends have asked me why they are starting to lose hair at a young age. In fact, this is largely related to the concept that "the kidneys manifest their vitality in the hair." Insufficient kidney energy naturally leads to a loss of shine and resilience in the hair. To improve this condition, in addition to "tonifying qi and nourishing essence," you can also try methods like "clearing heat and detoxifying," such as drinking chrysanthemum tea or honeysuckle tea to help the body detoxify. Moreover, in traditional Chinese medicine, there is a type of "emetic medicine" that can help the body expel excess toxins, but it should be used with caution. Additionally, you can regularly perform "insertion method" massages to help promote the flow of qi and blood, ensuring that the body is "connected through every joint." When qi and blood flow smoothly, the hair will naturally improve. Remember, health preservation should "follow the natural tendency downward," aligning with the laws of nature to achieve twice the result with half the effort!

情志病类是中医学中常见的一类疾病，其病因多与情绪波动、心理压力等因素密切相关。风热中络证则是情志病类中的一种典型表现，患者常伴有头痛、发热、咽喉肿痛等症状。在治疗上，中医强调辨证施治，对于气滞痰凝证的患者，常采用疏肝理气、化痰散结的方法。此外，止血安胎在妇科疾病中尤为重要，特别是在孕妇出现异常出血时，及时采取止血措施对保护胎儿健康至关重要。夜啼是婴幼儿常见的睡眠障碍，中医认为多与心火旺盛或脾胃不和有关，治疗上需调和心脾。滴脓疮则是一种皮肤感染性疾病，常见于湿热环境，治疗上需清热解毒、消肿止痛。寒痢是一种因寒邪侵袭引起的腹泻病症，治疗上需温中散寒、止泻固肠。掩法作为一种外治法，常用于治疗皮肤疾病，通过药物外敷达到治疗效果。综上所述，中医在治疗情志病类、风热中络证、气滞痰凝证等多种疾病时，均强调辨证施治，结合内外治法，以达到最佳疗效。||Emotional disorders are a common category of diseases in traditional Chinese medicine, often closely related to emotional fluctuations and psychological stress. Wind-heat invading the collaterals syndrome is a typical manifestation of emotional disorders, with patients often experiencing symptoms such as headache, fever, and sore throat. In treatment, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes syndrome differentiation and treatment. For patients with qi stagnation and phlegm coagulation syndrome, methods such as soothing the liver and regulating qi, and resolving phlegm and dissipating nodules are commonly used. Additionally, hemostasis and fetal protection are particularly important in gynecological diseases, especially when abnormal bleeding occurs in pregnant women, timely hemostatic measures are crucial for protecting fetal health. Night crying is a common sleep disorder in infants and young children, which traditional Chinese medicine believes is often related to excessive heart fire or spleen and stomach disharmony, requiring treatment to harmonize the heart and spleen. Pustular sores are a type of skin infectious disease, commonly seen in damp and hot environments, requiring treatment to clear heat and detoxify, reduce swelling, and relieve pain. Cold dysentery is a type of diarrhea caused by cold pathogen invasion, requiring treatment to warm the middle and dispel cold, stop diarrhea, and consolidate the intestines. The covering method, as an external treatment, is often used to treat skin diseases, achieving therapeutic effects through external application of medication. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes syndrome differentiation and treatment, combining internal and external treatments to achieve the best therapeutic effects in treating various diseases such as emotional disorders, wind-heat invading the collaterals syndrome, and qi stagnation and phlegm coagulation syndrome.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了胃胀病的情况，尤其是那些平时饮食不规律的朋友。中医认为，胃胀病多与脾胃虚弱有关，可以通过耳穴按摩来缓解症状。此外，皮肤类病也在这个季节高发，尤其是血风劳引起的皮肤问题，表现为瘙痒、干燥等。对于这类问题，中医常用祛瘀止血的方法来调理，帮助改善血液循环。如果症状较重，比如出现热入营血证，可能需要结合投火法进行治疗。对于儿童的五迟问题，家长也要多加关注，及时调理脾胃，避免影响生长发育。总之，日常养生要注重内外兼修，才能更好地应对季节变化带来的健康挑战。||The weather has been unpredictable lately, leading to many people experiencing stomach bloating, especially those with irregular eating habits. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes that stomach bloating is often related to spleen and stomach weakness, and symptoms can be alleviated through ear acupressure. Additionally, skin diseases are also prevalent during this season, particularly those caused by blood wind fatigue, which manifest as itching and dryness. For such issues, TCM commonly uses methods to remove stasis and stop bleeding to help improve blood circulation. If symptoms are severe, such as heat entering the nutrient-blood syndrome, fire needling therapy may be required. Parents should also pay attention to children's developmental delays, promptly regulate their spleen and stomach to avoid affecting growth and development. In summary, daily health maintenance should focus on both internal and external care to better cope with the health challenges brought by seasonal changes.

最近在门诊遇到一位孕妇，主诉妊娠腹痛，仔细询问后发现她还有脾虚生风证的表现，比如手脚发凉、容易出汗。这让我想起《内经》中提到的"作强之官"，也就是肾脏，它主水液代谢，与下焦如渎的功能密切相关。这位患者的情况，正是肾阳不足导致水液代谢失调，进而影响脾胃功能。治疗上我采用了汗法，配合温肾健脾的中药，效果显著。其实很多妇科问题都与肾气不足有关，比如常见的蛔厥，也是由于肾阳虚弱所致。建议大家平时要注意保暖，尤其是腰腹部，这样才能保持至数的平衡，让身体各脏腑功能协调运转。||Recently, I encountered a pregnant woman in the outpatient clinic who complained of abdominal pain during pregnancy. Upon careful inquiry, I found that she also exhibited symptoms of spleen deficiency with wind syndrome, such as cold hands and feet and a tendency to sweat easily. This reminded me of the "official of strength" mentioned in the "Inner Canon," which refers to the kidneys. The kidneys govern water metabolism and are closely related to the function of the lower burner like a ditch. This patient's condition was precisely due to insufficient kidney yang leading to water metabolism disorders, which in turn affected the spleen and stomach functions. In treatment, I used the sweating method combined with Chinese herbs that warm the kidneys and strengthen the spleen, with significant results. In fact, many gynecological issues are related to insufficient kidney qi, such as the common roundworm reversal, which is also caused by weak kidney yang. I recommend that everyone pay attention to keeping warm, especially around the waist and abdomen, to maintain the balance of the vital energy and ensure the coordinated functioning of the body's organs.

At this time, appropriately using some heat-clearing and deficiency-nourishing medicines can help alleviate these symptoms. Meanwhile, nourishing blood and moisturizing dryness are also key points for health preservation in autumn and winter. It is advisable to eat more foods that nourish yin and moisturize dryness, such as tremella and lily. For the wandering pain caused by lung heat disease, regulating qi is also very important, which can be achieved through deep breathing, yoga, and other methods to adjust the body's qi mechanism. In summary, health preservation in autumn and winter should focus on both internal and external cultivation, not only regulating the body but also paying attention to mental peace.

The combing method, as a traditional Chinese massage technique, can effectively relieve muscle tension and pain through gentle combing movements. The combination of acupuncture and cupping integrates the advantages of both, commonly used to treat conditions like wind-cold-dampness arthralgia. Stagnant appetite refers to poor appetite and indigestion caused by spleen and stomach weakness, often treated with warming and resolving cold phlegm agents to warm the middle and dispel cold, resolve phlegm, and stop cough. The theory of fire depression emphasizes treating various symptoms caused by internal heat stagnation by clearing heat and relieving depression. Eyelid drooping refers to the weakness and drooping of the eyelids, often related to spleen and stomach weakness or insufficient qi and blood. Yin cold refers to excessive yin qi or invasion of cold pathogens in the body, often manifested as cold intolerance, cold limbs, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

At this time, we can try some traditional Chinese medicine methods to alleviate the symptoms. For example, using a three-edged needle for spinal point therapy can help expand the back and relieve back discomfort. Meanwhile, if the cold is accompanied by symptoms of liver depression and blood deficiency, some astringent and consolidating agents can be considered to regulate the body. When choosing medications, the selection of excipients is also crucial as they can enhance the efficacy of the medicine. Additionally, if the pulse is weak, it indicates a weaker constitution, which necessitates regulation through traditional Chinese medicine methods. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine offers a variety of methods suitable for people with different constitutions and symptoms, and everyone can choose the appropriate treatment method based on their own condition.

最近天气转凉，不少朋友反映出现了“干脚气”的问题，脚部皮肤干燥、脱皮，甚至伴有瘙痒。中医认为，这与体内湿气滞留、经络不畅有关，即所谓的“滞颐”。通过“循经感传”的方法，可以刺激经络，促进气血流通，缓解症状。此外，观察舌象也是中医诊断的重要手段，如果你的舌苔呈现“淡红舌”，可能提示体内有热，尤其是“心恶热”的情况。对于喜欢饮酒的朋友，要注意“酒臌”的风险，长期饮酒可能导致脾胃湿热，影响健康。脉象上，“缓脉”常提示气血不足，需要调养。平时可以多按摩“浮络”，帮助疏通经络，增强体质。希望大家在秋冬季节注意保暖，调理身体，远离不适。||Recently, the weather has turned cooler, and many friends have reported experiencing "dry athlete's foot," characterized by dry, peeling skin on the feet, sometimes accompanied by itching. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) believes this is related to the retention of dampness in the body and poor meridian circulation, known as "stagnant dampness." By using the method of "meridian sensation transmission," one can stimulate the meridians, promote the flow of qi and blood, and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, observing the tongue is an important diagnostic tool in TCM. If your tongue coating appears "pale red," it may indicate internal heat, especially a condition known as "heart aversion to heat." For those who enjoy drinking alcohol, be aware of the risk of "alcohol-induced dampness," as long-term alcohol consumption can lead to damp-heat in the spleen and stomach, affecting health. In terms of pulse diagnosis, a "slow pulse" often indicates insufficient qi and blood, necessitating nourishment. Regularly massaging the "superficial collaterals" can help unblock the meridians and enhance physical constitution. It is hoped that everyone pays attention to keeping warm, regulating their body, and staying away from discomfort during the autumn and winter seasons.

在中医理论中，"金水相生"是指肺与肾之间的相互滋养关系，肺属金，肾属水，二者相辅相成。在治疗"热入气分证"时，常采用"温补肺阳"的方法，以增强肺的功能，进而促进肾水的生成。此外，耳穴疗法也是一种常用的治疗手段，通过在特定耳穴上使用"不锈钢针"进行刺激，可以达到调节体内气血的效果。在针灸操作中，"捻转法"是一种基本手法，通过旋转针体以增强治疗效果。同时，"靠法"作为一种辅助手法，用于稳定针体，确保治疗的准确性。对于便秘患者，"润燥通便"是常用的治疗原则，通过调节体内津液，达到缓解症状的目的。这些方法综合运用，能够有效提升治疗效果，体现了中医整体观念和辨证施治的特点。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "metal and water generate each other" refers to the mutual nourishing relationship between the lungs and kidneys, where the lungs belong to metal and the kidneys belong to water, complementing each other. When treating "heat entering the qi level syndrome," the method of "warming and tonifying lung yang" is often used to enhance lung function, thereby promoting the generation of kidney water. Additionally, auricular therapy is a commonly used treatment method, where stimulation of specific ear points with "stainless steel needles" can regulate the body's qi and blood. In acupuncture, the "twisting method" is a basic technique that enhances therapeutic effects by rotating the needle. Meanwhile, the "leaning method" serves as an auxiliary technique to stabilize the needle and ensure treatment accuracy. For patients with constipation, "moistening dryness and promoting bowel movement" is a common treatment principle, aimed at alleviating symptoms by regulating body fluids. The comprehensive application of these methods can effectively enhance treatment outcomes, reflecting the holistic concept and syndrome differentiation and treatment characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine.

在中医理论中，血瘀化热证是一种常见的病理状态，表现为局部疼痛、发热和红肿，常与寒滞经络证相鉴别。足太阳膀胱经证则涉及腰背疼痛和排尿异常，与五脏化液功能失调密切相关。痰热动风证则表现为咳嗽、痰黄稠和发热，需与痛痹相区分，后者以关节疼痛为主。在针灸治疗中，断针是一种罕见但需警惕的并发症。十天干在中医中用于描述时间和病理变化，为诊断和治疗提供时间依据。综合运用这些理论，中医师能够更准确地辨证施治，提升治疗效果。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, the syndrome of blood stasis transforming into heat is a common pathological state, characterized by local pain, fever, and redness, often distinguished from the syndrome of cold stagnation in the meridians. The syndrome of the Bladder Meridian of Foot-Taiyang involves lower back pain and abnormal urination, closely related to the dysfunction of fluid transformation in the five zang organs. The syndrome of phlegm-heat stirring wind manifests as cough, yellow and thick phlegm, and fever, which needs to be differentiated from painful obstruction, the latter mainly characterized by joint pain. In acupuncture treatment, needle breakage is a rare but concerning complication. The ten heavenly stems are used in traditional Chinese medicine to describe time and pathological changes, providing a temporal basis for diagnosis and treatment. By comprehensively applying these theories, practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine can more accurately differentiate syndromes and administer treatments, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

In fact, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes "increasing water to move the boat," and by regulating the Kidney Meridian of Foot Shaoyin, it can effectively alleviate cold dampness in the lower limbs. If you often feel restless and irritable, it may be due to "flaming heart fire syndrome," and it is recommended to try the "left-right acupoint pairing method," such as massaging the Taixi and Yongquan acupoints, which can balance yin and yang. Additionally, in terms of diet, it is important to avoid "spleen and stomach heat accumulation syndrome" by eating less spicy and greasy foods. For those suffering from "girdling fire rash," some external remedies, such as cooling ointment, can be tried with good results. In summary, health preservation requires both internal and external cultivation to achieve twice the result with half the effort!

在中医理论中，先天之气是人体生命活动的基础，其强弱直接影响个体的健康状况。五更泄泻是一种常见的消化系统疾病，常与先天之气不足有关。消渴类病则多因阴阳互损所致，表现为多饮、多尿、消瘦等症状。针对肺胃风热证，中医常采用通经止痒的中成药进行治疗，以调和气血，缓解症状。舌质的变化也是诊断这些疾病的重要依据，通过观察舌质的变化，可以判断病情的轻重和治疗的进展。因此，了解这些中医术语及其相互关系，对于疾病的预防和治疗具有重要意义。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, the innate qi is the foundation of human life activities, and its strength directly affects an individual's health status. Wugeng diarrhea is a common digestive system disease, often related to insufficient innate qi. Diabetes-like diseases are mostly caused by mutual damage of yin and yang, manifested as symptoms such as excessive drinking, frequent urination, and weight loss. For the syndrome of wind-heat in the lung and stomach, traditional Chinese medicine often uses patent medicines that promote meridian flow and relieve itching to regulate qi and blood, alleviating symptoms. Changes in the tongue's quality are also an important basis for diagnosing these diseases; by observing changes in the tongue's quality, the severity of the condition and the progress of treatment can be judged. Therefore, understanding these traditional Chinese medicine terms and their interrelationships is of great significance for the prevention and treatment of diseases.

在中医理论中，"子隐"常指体内潜在的病理变化，而"痰食互结证"则描述了痰湿与食积相互交织的复杂病机。长期的声音嘶哑，即"久瘖"，往往与"新感"外邪后的失治误治有关。在临床中，"痰核"的形成多因痰湿凝聚，而"精气亏虚证"则反映了人体精气的不足。"体阴而用阳"阐述了阴阳在人体中的动态平衡，而"肝肾两虚证"则指出了肝肾功能的衰退。这些术语共同描绘了中医对人体疾病复杂性的深刻理解，强调了辨证施治的重要性。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "zi yin" often refers to potential pathological changes within the body, while "tan shi hu jie zheng" describes the complex pathogenesis of phlegm-dampness and food stagnation intertwining. Long-term hoarseness, known as "jiu yin," is often related to improper treatment after new external pathogen invasion. In clinical practice, the formation of "tan he" is mostly due to the accumulation of phlegm-dampness, and "jing qi kui xu zheng" reflects the deficiency of the body's essence and qi. "Ti yin er yong yang" explains the dynamic balance of yin and yang in the human body, while "gan shen liang xu zheng" points to the decline in liver and kidney function. These terms collectively depict the profound understanding of the complexity of human diseases in traditional Chinese medicine, emphasizing the importance of syndrome differentiation and treatment.

在中医理论中，"司外揣内"是一种重要的诊断方法，通过观察外在症状来推断内在病理变化。例如，"心肾阳虚证"常表现为畏寒、四肢不温等症状，而"毒侵肺卫证"则多见于外感热病初期，表现为发热、咳嗽等。治疗上，"化痰开窍"常用于治疗痰蒙清窍所致的眩晕、头痛等症，而"透热转气"则是治疗外感热病的重要法则，旨在通过透发邪热，使病邪从表而解。此外，"懊憹"作为一种情志病证，常与心肾不交有关，治疗时需兼顾心肾两脏。在经络学说中，"十二正经"是人体气血运行的主要通道，其畅通与否直接关系到人体健康。最后，"暴盲"作为一种急性视力丧失的病症，多与肝火上炎或气血瘀阻有关，需及时诊治以防病情恶化。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "observing the exterior to infer the interior" is an important diagnostic method, which involves deducing internal pathological changes by observing external symptoms. For example, "deficiency of heart and kidney yang" often manifests as symptoms such as aversion to cold and cold limbs, while "toxin invading lung defense" is commonly seen in the early stages of external heat diseases, presenting with fever and cough. In terms of treatment, "resolving phlegm to open the orifices" is often used to treat dizziness and headaches caused by phlegm clouding the clear orifices, and "dispersing heat to transform qi" is an important principle in treating external heat diseases, aiming to release pathogenic heat and resolve the disease from the exterior. Additionally, "anxiety" as a type of emotional disorder is often related to the disharmony between the heart and kidney, and treatment should address both organs. In the theory of meridians, the "twelve regular meridians" are the main channels for the circulation of qi and blood in the body, and their patency directly affects overall health. Finally, "sudden blindness" as an acute condition of vision loss is often related to liver fire flaring up or qi and blood stasis, requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent worsening of the condition.

在中医理论中，"辨证论治"是诊断和治疗疾病的核心原则，尤其适用于如"温燥袭肺证"和"风中经络证"等复杂病症。温燥袭肺证常表现为咳嗽、口干，治疗时需考虑"五方"之地的气候特点，采用"扶脾化湿"的方法以调和体内环境。而风中经络证则可能引发"瘙瘊"，即皮肤瘙痒，此时需从"元神之府"——大脑的角度出发，调节神经系统功能。此外，"暴风客热"这一术语描述了外感风热迅速侵袭人体的状况，治疗时亦需迅速反应，以防病情恶化。通过综合运用这些中医术语和治疗方法，可以更有效地指导临床实践，提高治疗效果。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "syndrome differentiation and treatment" is the core principle for diagnosing and treating diseases, especially applicable to complex conditions such as "warm dryness invading the lung syndrome" and "wind invading the meridians syndrome." Warm dryness invading the lung syndrome often manifests as cough and dry mouth, and treatment requires considering the climatic characteristics of the "five regions," employing methods like "supporting the spleen and resolving dampness" to harmonize the internal environment. Wind invading the meridians syndrome may lead to "itching sores," or skin itching, necessitating an approach from the perspective of the "residence of the original spirit"—the brain, to regulate nervous system functions. Additionally, the term "violent wind guest heat" describes a condition where external wind-heat rapidly invades the body, requiring swift therapeutic response to prevent worsening of the condition.

Traditional Chinese Medicine believes this is related to liver qi stagnation and liver-spleen qi stagnation syndrome. Poor liver qi flow can easily lead to liver depression and blood deficiency syndrome, manifesting as low mood, fatigue, and weakness. Additionally, dental issues are often associated with excessive liver fire, especially in people with a slow pulse, who are more prone to gum bleeding. For patients with chronic tonsillitis, regulating liver qi is key, while also paying attention to avoid meridian blockages, which can cause pain due to blocked meridians. It is recommended to drink more warm water, maintain a cheerful mood, and appropriately massage the Taichong acupoint to help soothe the liver and regulate qi, alleviating the discomfort caused by liver-spleen qi stagnation syndrome.

在中医理论中，"阳中之阴"是一个重要的概念，它描述了在阳性体质中存在的阴性特征，这种阴阳的平衡对于维持健康至关重要。例如，在治疗"丹痧"时，中医师可能会采用"刺络拔罐"的方法，这种方法通过刺激经络来调节体内的气血流动，从而达到治疗效果。此外，"横痃"作为一种常见的病症，其治疗往往需要结合"提法"和"梳法"，这两种手法分别通过提升和梳理来缓解症状。在诊断过程中，"卫气营血辨证"是一种常用的方法，它帮助医师判断疾病的性质和位置，如"里证"通常指的是内部器官的病变。通过这些综合的治疗和诊断方法，中医能够有效地处理各种复杂的健康问题。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, "yin within yang" is an important concept that describes the presence of yin characteristics within a predominantly yang constitution. This balance of yin and yang is crucial for maintaining health. For example, in treating "dansha," a practitioner might use the "cupping and bloodletting" method, which stimulates the meridians to regulate the flow of qi and blood in the body, thereby achieving therapeutic effects. Additionally, "hengxuan," as a common condition, often requires a combination of "lifting" and "combing" techniques, which alleviate symptoms through lifting and combing actions. In the diagnostic process, "wei qi ying blood pattern differentiation" is a commonly used method that helps practitioners determine the nature and location of a disease, such as "internal patterns" which usually refer to disorders of internal organs. Through these comprehensive treatment and diagnostic methods, traditional Chinese medicine can effectively address various complex health issues.

最近天气变化无常，很多人出现了“火毒内闭证”的症状，比如口干舌燥、咽喉肿痛等。这时候，可以试试“悬灸”来缓解不适，悬灸不仅能“泄热存津”，还能帮助身体“开吸合呼”，调节呼吸。对于“燥毒证”引起的皮肤干燥、便秘等问题，可以服用一些“气血两清剂”，帮助身体排毒。此外，如果感觉体内有“痰阻精室”的情况，可以适当使用“固表止汗药”来调节体内的湿气。总之，中医讲究内外兼修，通过调理身体内部的平衡，来达到健康的状态。||The weather has been unpredictable lately, and many people are experiencing symptoms of "internal fire toxin blockage," such as dry mouth and sore throat. At this time, you can try "suspended moxibustion" to alleviate discomfort. Suspended moxibustion not only helps to "release heat and preserve fluids" but also aids the body in "opening to inhale and closing to exhale," regulating breathing. For issues like dry skin and constipation caused by "dry toxin syndrome," taking some "qi and blood clearing agents" can help detoxify the body. Additionally, if you feel there is "phlegm blocking the essence chamber" in your body, you can appropriately use "surface-stabilizing and sweat-stopping medicine" to regulate internal dampness. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes both internal and external cultivation, aiming to achieve a healthy state by balancing the body's internal equilibrium.

When "stomach yin deficiency syndrome" occurs, patients often experience dry mouth and poor appetite, necessitating nourishing yin and the stomach. "Liver yellow" refers to jaundice caused by liver dysfunction, commonly seen in liver and gallbladder diseases. Additionally, the "five colors" theory holds an important place in TCM diagnosis, where observing changes in facial and tongue colors can indicate the functional state of the internal organs. For example, "flushed cheeks" often suggest yin deficiency with excessive fire. For the treatment of "nasal hemorrhoids," TCM commonly employs methods to "dry dampness and move stagnation," focusing on clearing heat, drying dampness, and promoting qi and blood circulation. In acupuncture treatment, the "one-finger measurement" is a commonly used method for locating acupoints, determining their position based on the width of a finger, making it simple and practical. These TCM terms and theories provide a unique perspective on understanding human health.

Smallpox and measles are common infectious diseases in children, and traditional Chinese medicine believes that their causes are often related to the syndrome of fetal toxin accumulation and heat, where the heat toxin accumulated by the mother during pregnancy is transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. The failure of Qi to transform body fluids refers to the obstruction in the generation and distribution of body fluids due to the stagnation of Qi movement, commonly seen in patients with chronic diseases. Promoting blood circulation and Qi movement is an important principle in treating Qi stagnation and blood stasis in traditional Chinese medicine, aiming to alleviate symptoms by enhancing blood circulation and the movement of Qi. Tinea and scrofula are two different skin diseases; the former is often caused by damp-heat accumulation, while the latter is related to Qi and blood deficiency. Filariasis is a disease caused by parasites, and traditional Chinese medicine often employs methods of clearing heat and detoxifying, as well as promoting blood circulation and removing stasis for its treatment. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes holistic regulation and syndrome differentiation in treating these diseases to achieve both symptomatic and root-cause treatment effects.

钱癣是一种常见的皮肤病，常表现为皮肤红斑、鳞屑，与肝胃不调证密切相关。肝胃不调证多因情志不畅或饮食不节导致，患者常伴有腹胀、嗳气等症状。鼻槁则多见于肺胃阴虚，表现为鼻腔干燥、嗅觉减退。五劳是指久视、久卧、久坐、久立、久行五种过度劳损，易引发痰核、脓疱疮等病症。痰核多因痰湿凝结，常见于颈部或腋下，而脓疱疮则多由湿热毒邪所致，表现为皮肤脓疱、红肿。三关指风关、气关、命关，是中医诊断的重要部位，贯顶则是头部经络的重要穴位，常用于治疗头痛、眩晕等症。通过调理肝胃、祛痰化湿、疏通经络，可有效缓解上述病症。||Tinea is a common skin disease often manifested as erythema and scaling of the skin, closely related to liver and stomach disharmony syndrome. Liver and stomach disharmony syndrome is mostly caused by emotional distress or improper diet, with patients often experiencing symptoms such as abdominal distension and belching. Nasal atrophy is commonly seen in cases of lung and stomach yin deficiency, characterized by dry nasal passages and reduced sense of smell. The five fatigues refer to prolonged viewing, lying, sitting, standing, and walking, which can easily lead to conditions such as phlegm nodules and pustular sores. Phlegm nodules are often caused by the congealing of phlegm-dampness, commonly found in the neck or armpits, while pustular sores are mostly due to damp-heat toxins, presenting as skin pustules and redness. The three gates refer to the wind gate, qi gate, and life gate, which are important diagnostic areas in traditional Chinese medicine. Guanding is a crucial acupoint on the head's meridians, often used to treat headaches and dizziness. By regulating the liver and stomach, resolving phlegm and dampness, and dredging the meridians, the aforementioned conditions can be effectively alleviated.

在中医理论中，脾气虚证常表现为痞满、潮热等症状，这些症状多因饮食不当或外感暑湿所致。食毒类病则是指因食物中毒引发的疾病，其症状包括雷头风、暑厥等，严重时甚至可能导致胞虚如球。治疗上，中医强调化瘀理脾，通过调理脾胃功能，促进气血运行，从而缓解症状。例如，对于脾气虚证，可采用健脾益气的中药，如黄芪、白术等，以增强脾胃功能，改善痞满和潮热。同时，对于食毒类病，除了清热解毒外，还需注意饮食卫生，避免再次中毒。总之，中医治疗注重整体调理，通过化瘀理脾等方法，达到标本兼治的效果。||In traditional Chinese medicine theory, spleen qi deficiency syndrome often manifests as abdominal fullness and tidal fever, symptoms typically caused by improper diet or external exposure to summer dampness. Food poisoning diseases refer to illnesses caused by food poisoning, with symptoms including thunderhead wind and summer syncope, which in severe cases may even lead to a condition resembling a ball-like deficiency. In treatment, traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes resolving stasis and regulating the spleen, promoting the circulation of qi and blood by adjusting the functions of the spleen and stomach to alleviate symptoms. For instance, for spleen qi deficiency syndrome, spleen-strengthening and qi-boosting herbs such as Astragalus and Atractylodes can be used to enhance spleen and stomach functions and improve abdominal fullness and tidal fever. Meanwhile, for food poisoning diseases, besides clearing heat and detoxifying, attention to dietary hygiene is necessary to avoid re-poisoning. In summary, traditional Chinese medicine treatment focuses on holistic regulation, achieving both symptomatic and root-cause treatment through methods like resolving stasis and regulating the spleen.

最近在门诊遇到不少朋友因为胃肠瘀滞证来咨询，说总是感觉胃胀、消化不良，其实这和我们日常饮食不规律有很大关系。中医讲“营行脉中”，如果胃肠功能失调，气血运行不畅，就容易出现这种症状。还有一位患者因为长期脚底胼胝困扰，走路疼痛，这其实也是气血不畅的表现。另外，胸痹心痛的朋友也要注意，尤其是中老年人，如果经常感到胸闷、心慌，可能是心水病的早期信号。平时可以多关注自己的身体变化，比如通过闻诊类的方法，注意呼吸、气味等细节。至于鼻痔和乌痧胀，虽然听起来陌生，但它们也是生活中常见的健康问题，建议大家多了解中医知识，防患于未然。||Recently, I have encountered many friends in the clinic who came to consult about gastrointestinal stagnation syndrome, saying they always feel bloated and have indigestion. In fact, this is largely related to our irregular daily diet. Traditional Chinese medicine says "nutrients circulate in the meridians," and if gastrointestinal function is disordered, leading to poor circulation of qi and blood, such symptoms are likely to occur. Another patient was troubled by long-term calluses on the soles of their feet, causing pain when walking, which is also a manifestation of poor qi and blood circulation. Additionally, friends with chest pain and heartache should be cautious, especially middle-aged and elderly people. If you often feel chest tightness and palpitations, it might be an early sign of heart disease. You can usually pay more attention to changes in your body, such as through diagnostic methods like auscultation, paying attention to details like breathing and odors. As for nasal polyps and black sand distension, although they may sound unfamiliar, they are also common health issues in life. It is recommended that everyone learn more about traditional Chinese medicine knowledge to prevent problems before they arise.
